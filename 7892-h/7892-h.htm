    <h2>
      I. PREFACE TO READERS IN GENERAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      You are the children of Old Mother England, on both sides of the Atlantic;
      you form the majority of buyers and borrowers of novels; and you judge of
      works of fiction by certain inbred preferences, which but slightly
      influence the other great public of readers on the continent of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two qualities in fiction which hold the highest rank in your
      estimation are: Character and Humour. Incident and dramatic situation only
      occupy the second place in your favour. A novel that tells no story, or
      that blunders perpetually in trying to tell a story&mdash;a novel so
      entirely devoid of all sense of the dramatic side of human life, that not
      even a theatrical thief can find anything in it to steal&mdash;will
      nevertheless be a work that wins (and keeps) your admiration, if it has
      Humour which dwells on your memory, and characters which enlarge the
      circle of your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have myself always tried to combine the different merits of a good
      novel, in one and the same work; and I have never succeeded in keeping an
      equal balance. In the present story you will find the scales inclining, on
      the whole, in favour of character and Humour. This has not happened
      accidentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advancing years, and health that stands sadly in need of improvement, warn
      me&mdash;if I am to vary my way of work&mdash;that I may have little time
      to lose. Without waiting for future opportunities, I have kept your
      standard of merit more constantly before my mind, in writing this book,
      than on some former occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still persisting in telling you a story&mdash;still refusing to get up in
      the pulpit and preach, or to invade the platform and lecture, or to take
      you by the buttonhole in confidence and make fun of my Art&mdash;it has
      been my chief effort to draw the characters with a vigour and breadth of
      treatment, derived from the nearest and truest view that I could get of
      the one model, Nature. Whether I shall at once succeed in adding to the
      circle of your friends in the world of fiction&mdash;or whether you will
      hurry through the narrative, and only discover on a later reading that it
      is the characters which have interested you in the story&mdash;remains to
      be seen. Either way, your sympathy will find me grateful; for, either way,
      my motive has been to please you.
    </p>
    <p>
      During its periodical publication correspondents, noting certain passages
      in &ldquo;Heart and Science,&rdquo; inquired how I came to think of writing this book.
      The question may be readily answered in better words than mine. My book
      has been written in harmony with opinions which have an indisputable claim
      to respect. Let them speak for themselves.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     SHAKESPEARE&rsquo;S OPINION.&mdash;&ldquo;It was always yet the trick of our
English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common.&rdquo;
 <i>(King Henry IV., Part II.)</i>

     WALTER SCOTT&rsquo;S OPINION&mdash;&ldquo;I am no great believer in the extreme
degree of improvement to be derived from the advancement of Science; for
every study of that nature tends, when pushed to a certain extent, to
harden the heart.&rdquo; <i>(Letter to Miss Edgeworth.)</i>

     FARADAY&rsquo;S OPINION.&mdash;&ldquo;The education of the judgment has for its
first and its last step&mdash;Humility.&rdquo; <i>(Lecture on Mental Education, at
the Royal Institution.)</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Having given my reasons for writing the book, let me conclude by telling
      you what I have kept out of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      It encourages me to think that we have many sympathies in common; and
      among them, that most of us have taken to our hearts domestic pets.
      Writing under this conviction, I have not forgotten my responsibility
      towards you, and towards my Art, in pleading the cause of the harmless and
      affectionate beings of God&rsquo;s creation. From first to last, you are
      purposely left in ignorance of the hideous secrets of Vivisection. The
      outside of the laboratory is a necessary object in my landscape&mdash;but
      I never once open the door and invite you to look in. I trace, in one of
      my characters, the result of the habitual practice of cruelty (no matter
      under what pretence) in fatally deteriorating the nature of man&mdash;and
      I leave the picture to speak for itself. My own personal feeling has
      throughout been held in check. Thankfully accepting the assistance
      rendered to me by Miss Frances Power Cobbe, by Mrs. H. M. Gordon, and by
      Surgeon-General Gordon, C.B., I have borne in mind (as they have borne in
      mind) the value of temperate advocacy to a good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, your servant withdraws, and leaves you to the story.
    </p>

    <h2>
      II. TO READERS IN PARTICULAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you are numbered among those good friends of ours, who are especially
      capable of understanding us and sympathising with us, be pleased to accept
      the expression of our gratitude, and to pass over the lines that follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you open our books with a mind soured by distrust; if you
      habitually anticipate inexcusable ignorance where the course of the story
      happens to turn on matters of fact; it is you, Sir or Madam, whom I now
      want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to dispute with you&mdash;far from it! I own with sorrow that your
      severity does occasionally encounter us on assailable ground. But there
      are exceptions, even to the stiffest rules. Some of us are not guilty of
      wilful carelessness: some of us apply to competent authority, when we
      write on subjects beyond the range of our own experience. Having thus far
      ventured to speak for my colleagues, you will conclude that I am paving
      the way for speaking next of myself. As our cousins in the United States
      say&mdash;that is so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following pages, there are allusions to medical practice at the
      bedside; leading in due course to physiological questions which connect
      themselves with the main interest of the novel. In traversing this
      delicate ground, you have not been forgotten. Before the manuscript went
      to the printer, it was submitted for correction to an eminent London
      surgeon, whose experience extends over a period of forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: a supposed discovery in connection with brain disease, which
      occupies a place of importance, is not (as you may suspect) the fantastic
      product of the author&rsquo;s imagination. Finding his materials everywhere, he
      has even contrived to make use of Professor Ferrier&mdash;writing on the
      &ldquo;Localisation of Cerebral Disease,&rdquo; and closing a confession of the
      present result of post-mortem examination of brains in these words: &ldquo;We
      cannot even be sure, whether many of the changes discovered are the cause
      or the result of the Disease, or whether the two are the conjoint results
      of a common cause.&rdquo; Plenty of elbow room here for the spirit of discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On becoming acquainted with &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee,&rdquo; you will find her talking&mdash;and
      you will sometimes even find the author talking&mdash;of scientific
      subjects in general. You will naturally conclude that it is &ldquo;all gross
      caricature.&rdquo; No; it is all promiscuous reading. Let me spare you a long
      list of books consulted, and of newspapers and magazines mutilated for
      &ldquo;cuttings&rdquo;&mdash;and appeal to examples once more, and for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee&rdquo; wonders whether &ldquo;Carmina has ever heard of the
      Diathermancy of Ebonite,&rdquo; she is thinking of proceedings at a
      conversazione in honour of Professor Helmholtz (reported in the <i>Times</i>
      of April 12, 1881), at which &ldquo;radiant energy&rdquo; was indeed converted into
      &ldquo;sonorous vibrations.&rdquo; Again: when she contemplates taking part in a
      discussion on Matter, she has been slily looking into Chambers&rsquo;s
      Encyclopaedia, and has there discovered the interesting conditions on
      which she can &ldquo;dispense with the idea of atoms.&rdquo; Briefly, not a word of my
      own invention occurs, when Mrs. Gallilee turns the learned side of her
      character to your worships&rsquo; view.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now only to add that the story has been subjected to careful
      revision, and I hope to consequent improvement, in its present form of
      publication. Past experience has shown me that you have a sharp eye for
      slips of the pen, and that you thoroughly enjoy convicting a novelist, by
      post, of having made a mistake. Whatever pains I may have taken to
      disappoint you, it is quite likely that we may be again indebted to each
      other on this occasion. So, to our infinite relief on either side, we part
      friends after all.

      CHAPTER I.

    <p>
      The weary old nineteenth century had advanced into the last twenty years
      of its life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Ovid Vere (of the Royal College of
      Surgeons) stood at the window of his consulting-room in London, looking
      out at the summer sunshine, and the quiet dusty street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had received a warning, familiar to the busy men of our time&mdash;the
      warning from overwrought Nature, which counsels rest after excessive work.
      With a prosperous career before him, he had been compelled (at only
      thirty-one years of age) to ask a colleague to take charge of his
      practice, and to give the brain which he had cruelly wearied a rest of
      some months to come. On the next day he had arranged to embark for the
      Mediterranean in a friend&rsquo;s yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      An active man, devoted heart and soul to his profession, is not a man who
      can learn the happy knack of being idle at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Ovid found
      the mere act of looking out of window, and wondering what he should do
      next, more than he had patience to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to his study table. If he had possessed a wife to look after
      him, he would have been reminded that he and his study table had nothing
      in common, under present circumstances. Being deprived of conjugal
      superintendence, he broke though his own rules. His restless hand unlocked
      a drawer, and took out a manuscript work on medicine of his own writing.
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I may finish a chapter, before I go to sea
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head, steady enough while he was only looking out of window, began to
      swim before he had got to the bottom of a page. The last sentences of the
      unfinished chapter alluded to a matter of fact which he had not yet
      verified. In emergencies of any sort, he was a patient man and a man of
      resource. The necessary verification could be accomplished by a visit to
      the College of Surgeons, situated in the great square called Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
      Fields. Here was a motive for a walk&mdash;with an occupation at the end
      of it, which only involved a question to a Curator, and an examination of
      a Specimen. He locked up his manuscript, and set forth for Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
      Fields.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When two friends happen to meet in the street, do they ever look back
      along the procession of small circumstances which has led them both, from
      the starting-point of their own houses, to the same spot, at the same
      time? Not one man in ten thousand has probably ever thought of making such
      a fantastic inquiry as this. And consequently not one man in ten thousand,
      living in the midst of reality, has discovered that he is also living in
      the midst of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment when the young surgeon closed the door of his house, he
      was walking blindfold on his way to a patient in the future who was
      personally still a stranger to him. He never reached the College of
      Surgeons. He never embarked on his friend&rsquo;s yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were the obstacles which turned him aside from the course that he had
      in view? Nothing but a series of trivial circumstances, occurring in the
      experience of a man who goes out for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had only reached the next street, when the first of the circumstances
      presented itself in the shape of a friend&rsquo;s carriage, which drew up at his
      side. A bright benevolent face encircled by bushy white whiskers, looked
      out of the window, and a hearty voice asked him if he had completed his
      arrangements for a long holiday. Having replied to this, Ovid had a
      question to put, on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is our patient, Sir Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do the other doctors say now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard laughed: &ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s my luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not convinced yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. Who has ever succeeded in convincing fools? Let&rsquo;s try
      another subject. Is your mother reconciled to your new plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly tell you. My mother is in a state of indescribable
      agitation. Her brother&rsquo;s Will has been found in Italy. And his daughter
      may arrive in England at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unmarried?&rdquo; Sir Richard asked slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid smiled&mdash;not cheerfully. &ldquo;Do you think my poor mother would be in
      a state of indescribable agitation if there was <i>not</i> money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard was one of those obsolete elderly persons who quote
      Shakespeare. &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your mother is like Kent in King Lear&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      too old to learn. Is she as fond as ever of lace? and as keen as ever
      after a bargain?&rdquo; He handed a card out of the carriage window. &ldquo;I have
      just seen an old patient of mine,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;in whom I feel a friendly
      interest. She is retiring from business by my advice; and she asks me, of
      all the people in the world, to help her in getting rid of some wonderful
      &lsquo;remnants,&rsquo; at &lsquo;an alarming sacrifice!&rsquo; My kind regards to your mother&mdash;and
      there&rsquo;s a chance for her. One last word, Ovid. Don&rsquo;t be in too great a
      hurry to return to work; you have plenty of spare time before you. Look at
      my wise dog here, on the front seat, and learn from him to be idle and
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great physician had another companion, besides his dog. A friend,
      bound his way, had accepted a seat in the carriage. &ldquo;Who is that handsome
      young man?&rdquo; the friend asked as they drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the only son of a relative of mine, dead many years since,&rdquo; Sir
      Richard replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that you have seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not yet reached the prime of life; and he is on the way&mdash;already
      far on the way&mdash;to be one of the foremost men of his time. With a
      private fortune, he has worked as few surgeons work who have their bread
      to get by their profession. The money comes from his late father. His
      mother has married again. The second husband is a lazy, harmless old
      fellow, named Gallilee; possessed of one small attraction&mdash;fifty
      thousand pounds, grubbed up in trade. There are two little daughters, by
      the second marriage. With such a stepfather as I have described, and,
      between ourselves, with a mother who has rather more than her fair share
      of the jealous, envious, and money-loving propensities of humanity, my
      friend Ovid is not diverted by family influences from the close pursuit of
      his profession. You will tell me, he may marry. Well! if he gets a good
      wife she will be a circumstance in his favour. But, so far as I know, he
      is not that sort of man. Cooler, a deal cooler, with women than I am&mdash;though
      I am old enough to be his father. Let us get back to his professional
      prospects. You heard him ask me about a patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Death was knocking hard at that patient&rsquo;s door, when I called
      Ovid into consultation with myself and with two other doctors who differed
      with me. It was one of the very rare cases in which the old practice of
      bleeding was, to my mind, the only treatment to pursue. I never told him
      that this was the point in dispute between me and the other men&mdash;and
      they said nothing, on their side, at my express request. He took his time
      to examine and think; and he saw the chance of saving the patient by
      venturing on the use of the lancet as plainly as I did&mdash;with my forty
      years&rsquo; experience to teach me! A young man with that capacity for
      discovering the remote cause of disease, and with that superiority to the
      trammels of routine in applying the treatment, has no common medical
      career before him. His holiday will set his health right in next to no
      time. I see nothing in his way, at present&mdash;not even a woman! But,&rdquo;
       said Sir Richard, with the explanatory wink of one eye peculiar (like
      quotation from Shakespeare) to persons of the obsolete old time, <i>&ldquo;we</i>
      know better than to forecast the weather if a petticoat influence appears
      on the horizon. One prediction, however, I do risk. If his mother buys any
      of that lace&mdash;I know who will get the best of the bargain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conditions under which the old doctor was willing to assume the
      character of a prophet never occurred. Ovid remembered that he was going
      away on a long voyage&mdash;and Ovid was a good son. He bought some of the
      lace, as a present to his mother at parting; and, most assuredly, he got
      the worst of the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      His shortest way back to the straight course, from which he had deviated
      in making his purchase, led him into a by-street, near the flower and
      fruit market of Covent Garden. Here he met with the second in number of
      the circumstances which attended his walk. He found himself encountered by
      an intolerably filthy smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The market was not out of the direct way to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. He fled
      from the smell to the flowery and fruity perfumes of Covent Garden, and
      completed the disinfecting process by means of a basket of strawberries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did a poor ragged little girl, carrying a big baby, look with such
      longing eyes at the delicious fruit, that, as a kind-hearted man, he had
      no alternative but to make her a present of the strawberries? Why did two
      dirty boyfriends of hers appear immediately afterwards with news of Punch
      in a neighbouring street, and lead the little girl away with them? Why did
      these two new circumstances inspire him with a fear that the boys might
      take the strawberries away from the poor child, burdened as she was with a
      baby almost as big as herself? When we suffer from overwrought nerves we
      are easily disturbed by small misgivings. The idle man of wearied mind
      followed the friends of the street drama to see what happened, forgetful
      of the College of Surgeons, and finding a new fund of amusement in
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in the neighbouring street, he discovered that the Punch
      performance had come to an end&mdash;like some other dramatic performances
      of higher pretensions&mdash;for want of a paying audience. He waited at a
      certain distance, watching the children. His doubts had done them an
      injustice. The boys only said, &ldquo;Give us a taste.&rdquo; And the liberal little
      girl rewarded their good conduct. An equitable and friendly division of
      the strawberries was made in a quiet corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where&mdash;always excepting the case of a miser or a millionaire&mdash;is
      the man to be found who could have returned to the pursuit of his own
      affairs, under these circumstances, without encouraging the practice of
      the social virtues by a present of a few pennies? Ovid was not that man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting back in his breast-pocket the bag in which he was accustomed to
      carry small coins for small charities, his hand touched something which
      felt like the envelope of a letter. He took it out&mdash;looked at it with
      an expression of annoyance and surprise&mdash;and once more turned aside
      from the direct way to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envelope contained his last prescription. Having occasion to consult
      the &ldquo;Pharmacopoeia,&rdquo; he had written it at home, and had promised to send
      it to the patient immediately. In the absorbing interest of making his
      preparations for leaving England, it had remained forgotten in his pocket
      for nearly two days. The one means of setting this unlucky error right,
      without further delay, was to deliver his prescription himself, and to
      break through his own rules for the second time by attending to a case of
      illness&mdash;purely as an act of atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patient lived in a house nearly opposite to the British Museum. In
      this northward direction he now set his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his apologies, and gave his advice&mdash;and, getting out again
      into the street, tried once more to shape his course for the College of
      Surgeons. Passing the walled garden of the British Museum, he looked
      towards it&mdash;and paused. What had stopped him, this time? Nothing but
      a tree, fluttering its bright leaves in the faint summer air.
    </p>
    <p>
      A marked change showed itself in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment before he had been passing in review the curious little
      interruptions which had attended his walk, and had wondered humorously
      what would happen next. Two women, meeting him, and seeing a smile on his
      lips, had said to each other, &ldquo;There goes a happy man.&rdquo; If they had
      encountered him now, they might have reversed their opinion. They would
      have seen a man thinking of something once dear to him, in the far and
      unforgotten past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed over the road to the side-street which faced the garden. His
      head drooped; he moved mechanically. Arrived in the street, he lifted his
      eyes, and stood (within nearer view of it) looking at the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hundreds of miles away from London, under another tree of that gentle
      family, this man&mdash;so cold to women in after life&mdash;had made
      child-love, in the days of his boyhood, to a sweet little cousin long
      since numbered with the dead. The present time, with its interests and
      anxieties, passed away like the passing of a dream. Little by little, as
      the minutes followed each other, his sore heart felt a calming influence,
      breathed mysteriously from the fluttering leaves. Still forgetful of the
      outward world, he wandered slowly up the street; living in the old scenes;
      thinking, not unhappily now, the old thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where, in all London, could he have found a solitude more congenial to a
      dreamer in daylight?
    </p>
    <p>
      The broad district, stretching northward and eastward from the British
      Museum, is like the quiet quarter of a country town set in the midst of
      the roaring activities of the largest city in the world. Here, you can
      cross the road, without putting limb or life in peril. Here, when you are
      idle, you can saunter and look about, safe from collision with merciless
      straight-walkers whose time is money, and whose destiny is business. Here,
      you may meet undisturbed cats on the pavement, in the full glare of
      noontide, and may watch, through the railings of the squares, children at
      play on grass that almost glows with the lustre of the Sussex Downs. This
      haven of rest is alike out of the way of fashion and business; and is yet
      within easy reach of the one and the other. Ovid paused in a vast and
      silent square. If his little cousin had lived, he might perhaps have seen
      his children at play in some such secluded place as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birds were singing blithely in the trees. A tradesman&rsquo;s boy,
      delivering fish to the cook, and two girls watering flowers at a window,
      were the only living creatures near him, as he roused himself and looked
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was the College? Where were the Curator and the Specimen? Those
      questions brought with them no feeling of anxiety or surprise. He turned,
      in a half-awakened way, without a wish or a purpose&mdash;turned, and
      listlessly looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two foot-passengers, dressed in mourning garments, were rapidly
      approaching him. One of them, as they came nearer, proved to be an aged
      woman. The other was a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew aside to let them pass. They looked at him with the lukewarm
      curiosity of strangers, as they went by. The girl&rsquo;s eyes and his met. Only
      the glance of an instant&mdash;and its influence held him for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went swiftly on, as little impressed by the chance meeting as the old
      woman at her side. Without stopping to think&mdash;without being capable
      of thought&mdash;Ovid followed them. Never before had he done what he was
      doing now; he was, literally, out of himself. He saw them ahead of him,
      and he saw nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the middle of the square, they turned aside into a street on the
      left. A concert-hall was in the street&mdash;with doors open for an
      afternoon performance. They entered the hall. Still out of himself, Ovid
      followed them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A room of magnificent size; furnished with every conventional luxury that
      money can buy; lavishly provided with newspapers and books of reference;
      lighted by tall windows in the day-time, and by gorgeous chandeliers at
      night, may be nevertheless one of the dreariest places of rest and shelter
      that can be found on the civilised earth. Such places exist, by hundreds,
      in those hotels of monstrous proportions and pretensions, which now engulf
      the traveller who ends his journey on the pier or the platform. It may be
      that we feel ourselves to be strangers among strangers&mdash;it may be
      that there is something innately repellent in splendid carpets and
      curtains, chairs and tables, which have no social associations to
      recommend them&mdash;it may be that the mind loses its elasticity under
      the inevitable restraint on friendly communication, which expresses itself
      in lowered tones and instinctive distrust of our next neighbour; but this
      alone is certain: life, in the public drawing-room of a great hotel, is
      life with all its healthiest emanations perishing in an exhausted
      receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same day, and nearly at the same hour, when Ovid had left his
      house, two women sat in a corner of the public room, in one of the largest
      of the railway hotels latterly built in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without observing it themselves, they were objects of curiosity to their
      fellow-travellers. They spoke to each other in a foreign language. They
      were dressed in deep mourning&mdash;with an absence of fashion and a
      simplicity of material which attracted the notice of every other woman in
      the room. One of them wore a black veil over her gray hair. Her hands were
      brown, and knotty at the joints; her eyes looked unnaturally bright for
      her age; innumerable wrinkles crossed and re-crossed her skinny face; and
      her aquiline nose (as one of the ladies present took occasion to remark)
      was so disastrously like the nose of the great Duke of Wellington as to be
      an offensive feature in the face of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady&rsquo;s companion, being a man, took a more merciful view. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t
      help being ugly,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;But see how she looks at the girl with
      her. A good old creature, I say, if ever there was one yet.&rdquo; The lady eyed
      him, as only a jealous woman can eye her husband, and whispered back, &ldquo;Of
      course you&rsquo;re in love with that slip of a girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She <i>was</i> a slip of a girl&mdash;and not even a tall slip. At
      seventeen years of age, it was doubtful whether she would ever grow to a
      better height.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a girl who is too thin, and not even so tall as the Venus de&rsquo; Medici,
      may still be possessed of personal attractions. It was not altogether a
      matter of certainty, in this case, that the attractions were sufficiently
      remarkable to excite general admiration. The fine colour and the plump
      healthy cheeks, the broad smile, and the regular teeth, the well-developed
      mouth, and the promising bosom which form altogether the average type of
      beauty found in the purely bred English maiden, were not among the
      noticeable charms of the small creature in gloomy black, shrinking into a
      corner of the big room. She had very little colour of any sort to boast
      of. Her hair was of so light a brown that it just escaped being flaxen;
      but it had the negative merit of not being forced down to her eyebrows,
      and twisted into the hideous curly-wig which exhibits a liberal equality
      of ugliness on the heads of women in the present day. There was a delicacy
      of finish in her features&mdash;in the nose and the lips especially&mdash;a
      sensitive changefulness in the expression of her eyes (too dark in
      themselves to be quite in harmony with her light hair), and a subtle yet
      simple witchery in her rare smile, which atoned, in some degree at least,
      for want of complexion in the face and of flesh in the figure. Men might
      dispute her claims to beauty&mdash;but no one could deny that she was, in
      the common phrase, an interesting person. Grace and refinement; a
      quickness of apprehension and a vivacity of movement, suggestive of some
      foreign origin; a childish readiness of wonder, in the presence of new
      objects&mdash;and perhaps, under happier circumstances, a childish
      playfulness with persons whom she loved&mdash;were all characteristic
      attractions of the modest stranger who was in the charge of the ugly old
      woman, and who was palpably the object of that wrinkled duenna&rsquo;s devoted
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      A travelling writing-case stood open on a table near them. In an interval
      of silence the girl looked at it reluctantly. They had been talking of
      family affairs&mdash;and had spoken in Italian, so as to keep their
      domestic secrets from the ears of the strangers about them. The old woman
      was the first to resume the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Carmina, you really ought to write that letter,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the
      illustrious Mrs. Gallilee is waiting to hear of our arrival in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina took up the pen, and put it down again with a sigh. &ldquo;We only
      arrived last night,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Dear old Teresa, let us have one day in
      London by ourselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa received this proposal with undisguised amazement and alarm,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesu Maria! a day in London&mdash;and your aunt waiting for you all the
      time! She is your second mother, my dear, by appointment; and her house is
      your new home. And you propose to stop a whole day at an hotel, instead of
      going home. Impossible! Write, my Carmina&mdash;write. See, here is the
      address on a card:&mdash;&lsquo;Fairfield Gardens.&rsquo; What a pretty place it must
      be to live in, with such a name as that! And a sweet lady, no doubt. Come!
      Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Carmina still resisted. &ldquo;I have never even seen my aunt,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;It is dreadful to pass my life with a stranger. Remember, I was only a
      child when you came to us after my mother&rsquo;s death. It is hardly six months
      yet since I lost my father. I have no one but you, and, when I go to this
      new home, you will leave me. I only ask for one more day to be together,
      before we part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor old duenna drew back out of sight, in the shadow of a curtain&mdash;and
      began to cry. Carmina took her hand, under cover of a tablecloth; Carmina
      knew how to console her. &ldquo;We will go and see sights,&rdquo; she whispered &ldquo;and,
      when dinner-time comes, you shall have a glass of the Porto-porto-wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa looked round out of the shadow, as easily comforted as a child.
      &ldquo;Sights!&rdquo; she exclaimed&mdash;and dried her tears. &ldquo;Porto-porto-wine!&rdquo; she
      repeated&mdash;and smacked her withered lips at the relishing words. &ldquo;Ah,
      my child, you have not forgotten the consolations I told you of, when I
      lived in London in my young days. To think of you, with an English father,
      and never in London till now! I used to go to museums and concerts
      sometimes, when my English mistress was pleased with me. That gracious
      lady often gave me a glass of the fine strong purple wine. The Holy Virgin
      grant that Aunt Gallilee may be as kind a woman! Such a head of hair as
      the other one she cannot hope to have. It was a joy to dress it. Do you
      think I wouldn&rsquo;t stay here in England with you if I could? What is to
      become of my old man in Italy, with his cursed asthma, and nobody to nurse
      him? Oh, but those were dull years in London! The black endless streets&mdash;the
      dreadful Sundays&mdash;the hundreds of thousands of people, always in a
      hurry; always with grim faces set on business, business, business! I was
      glad to go back and be married in Italy. And here I am in London again,
      after God knows how many years. No matter. We will enjoy ourselves to-day;
      and when we go to Madam Gallilee&rsquo;s to-morrow, we will tell a little lie,
      and say we only arrived on the evening that has not yet come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duenna&rsquo;s sense of humour was so tickled by this prospective view of
      the little lie, that she leaned back in her chair and laughed. Carmina&rsquo;s
      rare smile showed itself faintly. The terrible first interview with the
      unknown aunt still oppressed her. She took up a newspaper in despair. &ldquo;Oh,
      my old dear!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us get out of this dreadful room, and be
      reminded of Italy!&rdquo; Teresa lifted her ugly hands in bewilderment.
      &ldquo;Reminded of Italy&mdash;in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no Italian music in London?&rdquo; Carmina asked suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duenna&rsquo;s bright eyes answered this in their own language. She snatched
      up the nearest newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then the height of the London concert season. Morning performances
      of music were announced in rows. Reading the advertised programmes,
      Carmina found them, in one remarkable respect, all alike. They would have
      led an ignorant stranger to wonder whether any such persons as Italian
      composers, French composers, and English composers had ever existed. The
      music offered to the English public was music of exclusively German (and
      for the most part modern German) origin. Carmina held the opinion&mdash;in
      common with Mozart and Rossini, as well as other people&mdash;that music
      without melody is not music at all. She laid aside the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of going to a concert being thus abandoned, the idea occurred to
      them of seeing pictures. Teresa, in search of information, tried her luck
      at a great table in the middle of the room, on which useful books were
      liberally displayed. She returned with a catalogue of the Royal Academy
      Exhibition (which someone had left on the table), and with the most
      universally well-informed book, on a small scale, that has ever
      enlightened humanity&mdash;modestly described on the title-page as an
      Almanac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina opened the catalogue at the first page, and discovered a list of
      Royal Academicians. Were all these gentlemen celebrated painters? Out of
      nearly forty names, three only had made themselves generally known beyond
      the limits of England. She turned to the last page. The works of art on
      show numbered more than fifteen hundred. Teresa, looking over her
      shoulder, made the same discovery. &ldquo;Our heads will ache, and our feet will
      ache,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;before we get out of that place.&rdquo; Carmina laid aside
      the catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa opened the Almanac at hazard, and hit on the page devoted to
      Amusements. Her next discovery led her to the section inscribed &ldquo;Museums.&rdquo;
       She scored an approving mark at that place with her thumbnail&mdash;and
      read the list in fluent broken English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British Museum? Teresa&rsquo;s memory of that magnificent building recalled
      it vividly in one respect. She shook her head. &ldquo;More headache and
      footache, there!&rdquo; Bethnal Green; Indian Museum; College of Surgeons;
      Practical Geology; South Kensington; Patent Museum&mdash;all unknown to
      Teresa. &ldquo;The saints preserve us! what headaches and footaches in all
      these, if they are as big as that other one!&rdquo; She went on with the list&mdash;and
      astonished everybody in the room by suddenly clapping her hands. Sir John
      Soane&rsquo;s Museum, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. &ldquo;Ah, but I remember that! A nice
      little easy museum in a private house, and all sorts of pretty things to
      see. My dear love, trust your old Teresa. Come to Soane!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes more they were dressed, and on the steps of the hotel. The
      bright sunlight, the pleasant air, invited them to walk. On the same
      afternoon, when Ovid had set forth on foot for Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields,
      Carmina and Teresa set forth on foot for Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. Trivial
      obstacles had kept the man away from the College. Would trivial obstacles
      keep the women away from the Museum?
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the Strand, and entered a street which led out of it towards
      the North; Teresa&rsquo;s pride in her memory forbidding her thus far to ask
      their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their talk&mdash;dwelling at first on Italy, and on the memory of
      Carmina&rsquo;s Italian mother&mdash;reverted to the formidable subject of Mrs.
      Gallilee. Teresa&rsquo;s hopeful view of the future turned to the cousins, and
      drew the picture of two charming little girls, eagerly waiting to give
      their innocent hearts to their young relative from Italy. &ldquo;Are there only
      two?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Surely you told me there was a boy, besides the girls?&rdquo;
       Carmina set her right. &ldquo;My cousin Ovid is a great doctor,&rdquo; she continued
      with an air of importance. &ldquo;Poor papa used to say that our family would
      have reason to be proud of him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Does he live at home?&rdquo; asked simple
      Teresa. &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! He has a grand house of his own. Hundreds of sick
      people go there to be cured, and give hundreds of golden guineas.&rdquo;
       Hundreds of golden guineas gained by only curing sick people, represented
      to Teresa&rsquo;s mind something in the nature of a miracle: she solemnly raised
      her eyes to heaven. &ldquo;What a cousin to have! Is he young? is he handsome?
      is he married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering these questions, Carmina looked over her shoulder.
      &ldquo;Is this poor creature following us?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now turned to the right, and had entered a busy street leading
      directly to Covent Garden. The &ldquo;creature&rdquo; (who was undoubtedly following
      them) was one of the starved and vagabond dogs of London. Every now and
      then, the sympathies of their race lead these inveterate wanderers to
      attach themselves, for the time, to some human companion, whom their
      mysterious insight chooses from the crowd. Teresa, with the hard feeling
      towards animals which is one of the serious defects of the Italian
      character, cried, &ldquo;Ah, the mangy beast!&rdquo; and lifted her umbrella. The dog
      starred back, waited a moment, and followed them again as they went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s gentle heart gave its pity to this lost and hungry
      fellow-creature. &ldquo;I must buy that poor dog something to eat,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and
      stopped suddenly as the idea struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog, accustomed to kicks and curses, was ignorant of kindness.
      Following close behind her, when she checked herself, he darted away in
      terror into the road. A cab was driven by rapidly at the same moment. The
      wheel passed over the dog&rsquo;s neck. And there was an end, as a man remarked
      looking on, of the troubles of a cur.
    </p>
    <p>
      This common accident struck the girl&rsquo;s sensitive nature with horror.
      Helpless and speechless, she trembled piteously. The nearest open door was
      the door of a music-seller&rsquo;s shop. Teresa led her in, and asked for a
      chair and a glass of water. The proprietor, feeling the interest in
      Carmina which she seldom failed to inspire among strangers, went the
      length of offering her a glass of wine. Preferring water, she soon
      recovered herself sufficiently to be able to leave her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I change my mind about going to the museum?&rdquo; she said to her
      companion. &ldquo;After what has happened, I hardly feel equal to looking at
      curiosities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa&rsquo;s ready sympathy tried to find some acceptable alternative. &ldquo;Music
      would be better, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The so-called Italian Opera was open that night, and the printed
      announcement of the performance was in the shop. They both looked at it.
      Fortune was still against them. A German opera appeared on the bill.
      Carmina turned to the music-seller in despair. &ldquo;Is there no music, sir,
      but German music to be heard in London?&rdquo; she asked. The hospitable
      shopkeeper produced a concert programmed for that afternoon&mdash;the
      modest enterprise of an obscure piano-forte teacher, who could only
      venture to address pupils, patrons, and friends. What did he promise?
      Among other things, music from &ldquo;Lucia,&rdquo; music from &ldquo;Norma,&rdquo; music from
      &ldquo;Ernani.&rdquo; Teresa made another approving mark with her thumb-nail; and
      Carmina purchased tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music-seller hurried to the door to stop the first empty cab that
      might pass. Carmina showed a deplorable ignorance of the law of chances.
      She shrank from the bare idea of getting into a cab. &ldquo;We may run over some
      other poor creature,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t a dog, it may be a child next
      time.&rdquo; Teresa and the music-seller suggested a more reasonable view as
      gravely as they could. Carmina humbly submitted to the claims of common
      sense&mdash;without yielding, for all that. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m wrong,&rdquo; she
      confessed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil my pleasure; I can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strange parallel was now complete. Bound for the same destination,
      Carmina and Ovid had failed to reach it alike. And Carmina had stopped to
      look at the garden of the British Museum, before she overtook Ovid in the
      quiet square.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If, on entering the hall, Ovid had noticed the placards, he would have
      found himself confronted by a coincidence. The person who gave the concert
      was also the person who taught music to his half-sisters. Not many days
      since, he had himself assisted the enterprise, by taking a ticket at his
      mother&rsquo;s request. Seeing nothing, remembering nothing&mdash;hurried by the
      fear of losing sight of the two strangers if there was a large audience&mdash;he
      impatiently paid for another ticket, at the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was little more than half full, and so insufficiently ventilated
      that the atmosphere was oppressive even under those circumstances. He
      easily discovered the two central chairs, in the midway row of seats,
      which she and her companion had chosen. There was a vacant chair (among
      many others) at one extremity of the row in front of them. He took that
      place. To look at her, without being discovered&mdash;there, so far, was
      the beginning and the end of his utmost desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The performances had already begun. So long as her attention was directed
      to the singers and players on the platform, he could feast his eyes on her
      with impunity. In an unoccupied interval, she looked at the audience&mdash;and
      discovered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he offended her?
    </p>
    <p>
      If appearances were to be trusted, he had produced no impression of any
      sort. She quietly looked away, towards the other side of the room. The
      mere turning of her head was misinterpreted by Ovid as an implied rebuke.
      He moved to the row of seats behind her. She was now nearer to him than
      she had been yet. He was again content, and more than content. The next
      performance was a solo on the piano. A round of applause welcomed the
      player. Ovid looked at the platform for the first time. In the bowing man,
      with a prematurely bald head and a servile smile, he recognized Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s music-master. The inevitable inference followed. His mother
      might be in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After careful examination of the scanty audience, he failed to discover
      her&mdash;thus far. She would certainly arrive, nevertheless. My money&rsquo;s
      worth for my money was a leading principle in Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed as he looked towards the door of entrance. Not for long had he
      revelled in the luxury of a new happiness. He had openly avowed his
      dislike of concerts, when his mother had made him take a ticket for this
      concert. With her quickness of apprehension what might she not suspect, if
      she found him among the audience?
    </p>
    <p>
      Come what might of it, he still kept his place; he still feasted his eyes
      on the slim figure of the young girl, on the gentle yet spirited carriage
      of her head. But the pleasure was no longer pleasure without alloy. His
      mother had got between them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solo on the piano came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interval that followed, he turned once more towards the entrance.
      Just as he was looking away again, he heard Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s loud voice.
      She was administering a maternal caution to one of the children. &ldquo;Behave
      better here than you behaved in the carriage, or I shall take you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she found him in his present place&mdash;if she put her own clever
      construction on what she saw&mdash;her opinion would assuredly express
      itself in some way. She was one of those women who can insult another
      woman (and safely disguise it) by an inquiring look. For the girl&rsquo;s sake,
      Ovid instantly moved away from her to the seats at the back of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee made a striking entrance&mdash;dressed to perfection;
      powdered and painted to perfection; leading her daughters, and followed by
      her governess. The usher courteously indicated places near the platform.
      Mrs. Galilee astonished him by a little lecture on acoustics, delivered
      with the sweetest condescension. Her Christian humility smiled, and call
      the usher, Sir. &ldquo;Sound, sir, is most perfectly heard towards the centre of
      the auditorium.&rdquo; She led the way towards the centre. Vacant places invited
      her to the row of seats occupied by Carmina and Teresa. She, the unknown
      aunt, seated herself next to the unknown niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, it was the heat of the room. Perhaps, she had not perfectly
      recovered the nervous shock of seeing the dog killed. Carmina&rsquo;s head sank
      on good Teresa&rsquo;s shoulder. She had fainted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;May I ask for a cup of tea, Miss Minerva?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted, I&rsquo;m sure, Mr. Le Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was Mrs. Gallilee pleased with the Concert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank shook his head. &ldquo;I am afraid there was a drawback,&rdquo; he
      suggested. &ldquo;You forget the lady who fainted. So alarming to the audience.
      So disagreeable to the artists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Mr. Le Frank! These new houses are flimsily built; they might
      hear you upstairs. The fainting lady is upstairs. All the elements of a
      romance are upstairs. Is your tea to your liking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this playfully provocative manner, Miss Minerva (the governess) trifled
      with the curiosity of Mr. Le Frank (the music-master), as the proverbial
      cat trifles with the terror of the captive mouse. The man of the bald head
      and the servile smile showed a polite interest in the coming disclosure;
      he opened his deeply-sunk eyes, and lazily lifted his delicate eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had called at Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s house, after the concert, to get a little
      tea (with a large infusion of praise) in the schoolroom. A striking
      personal contrast confronted him, in the face of the lady who was
      dispensing the hospitalities of the table. Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s plump cheeks
      were, in colour, of the obtrusively florid sort. The relics of yellow
      hair, still adhering to the sides of his head, looked as silkily frail as
      spun glass. His noble beard made amends for his untimely baldness. The
      glossy glory of it exhaled delicious perfumes; the keenest eyes might have
      tried in vain to discover a hair that was out of place. Miss Minerva&rsquo;s
      eager sallow face, so lean, and so hard, and so long, looked, by contrast,
      as if it wanted some sort of discreet covering thrown over some part of
      it. Her coarse black hair projected like a penthouse over her bushy black
      eyebrows and her keen black eyes. Oh, dear me (as they said in the
      servants&rsquo; hall), she would never be married&mdash;so yellow and so
      learned, so ugly and so poor! And yet, if mystery is interesting, this was
      an interesting woman. The people about her felt an uneasy perception of
      something secret, ominously secret, in the nature of the governess which
      defied detection. If Inquisitive Science, vowed to medical research, could
      dissect firmness of will, working at its steadiest repressive action&mdash;then,
      the mystery of Miss Minerva&rsquo;s inner nature might possibly have been
      revealed. As it was, nothing more remarkable exposed itself to view than
      an irritable temper; serving perhaps as safety-valve to an underlying
      explosive force, which (with strong enough temptation and sufficient
      opportunity) might yet break out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, Mr. Le Frank! The tea is hot&mdash;you may burn your mouth. How
      am I to tell you what has happened?&rdquo; Miss Minerva dropped the playfully
      provocative tone, with infinite tact, exactly at the right moment. &ldquo;Just
      imagine,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;a scene on the stage, occurring in private life.
      The lady who fainted at your concert, turns out to be no less a person
      that Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s niece!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general folly which reads a prospectus and blindly speculates in
      shares, is matched by the equally diffused stupidity, which is incapable
      of discovering that there can be any possible relation between fiction and
      truth. Say it&rsquo;s in a novel&mdash;and you are a fool if you believe it. Say
      it&rsquo;s in a newspaper&mdash;and you are a fool if you doubt it. Mr. Le
      Frank, following the general example, followed it on this occasion a
      little too unreservedly. He avowed his doubts of the circumstance just
      related, although it was, on the authority of a lady, a circumstance
      occurring in real life! Far from being offended, Miss Minerva cordially
      sympathized with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> too theatrical to be believed,&rdquo; she admitted; &ldquo;but this
      fainting young person is positively the interesting stranger we have been
      expecting from Italy. You know Mrs. Gallilee. Hers was the first
      smelling-bottle produced; hers was the presence of mind which suggested a
      horizontal position. &lsquo;Help the heart,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t impede it.&rsquo; The
      whole theory of fainting fits, in six words! In another moment,&rdquo; proceeded
      the governess making a theatrical point without suspecting it&mdash;&ldquo;in
      another moment, Mrs. Gallilee herself stood in need of the
      smelling-bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank was not a true believer, even yet. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean <i>she</i>
      fainted!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva held up the indicative forefinger, with which she emphasized
      instruction when her pupils required rousing. &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s strength of
      mind&mdash;as I was about to say, if you had listened to me&mdash;resisted
      the shock. What the effort must have cost her you will presently
      understand. Our interesting young lady was accompanied by a hideous old
      foreign woman who completely lost her head. She smacked her hands
      distractedly; she called on the saints (without producing the slightest
      effect)&mdash;but she mixed up a name, remarkable even in Italy, with the
      rest of the delirium; and <i>that</i> was serious. Put yourself in Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Mr. Le Frank, with humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva passed over this reply without notice. Perhaps she was not a
      believer in the humility of musicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady&rsquo;s Christian name,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;is Carmina; (put the
      accent, if you please, on the <i>first</i> syllable). The moment Mrs.
      Gallilee heard the name, it struck her like a blow. She enlightened the
      old woman, and asserted herself as Miss Carmina&rsquo;s aunt in an instant. &lsquo;I
      am Mrs. Gallilee:&rsquo; that was all she said. The result&rdquo;&mdash;Miss Minerva
      paused, and pointed to the ceiling; &ldquo;the result is up there. Our charming
      guest was on the sofa, and the hideous old nurse was fanning her, when I
      had the honour of seeing them just now. No, Mr. Le Frank! I haven&rsquo;t done
      yet. There is a last act in this drama of private life still to relate. A
      medical gentleman was present at the concert, who offered his services in
      reviving Miss Carmina. The same gentleman is now in attendance on the
      interesting patient. Can you guess who he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank had sold a ticket for his concert to the medical adviser of
      the family&mdash;one Mr. Null. A cautious guess in this direction seemed
      to offer the likeliest chance of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a patron of music,&rdquo; the pianist began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hates music,&rdquo; the governess interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean Mr. Null,&rdquo; Mr. Le Frank persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I</i> mean&mdash;&rdquo; Miss Minerva paused (like the cat with the mouse
      again!)&mdash;<i>&ldquo;I</i> mean, Mr. Ovid Vere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What form the music-master&rsquo;s astonishment might have assumed may be matter
      for speculation, it was never destined to become matter of fact. At the
      moment when Miss Minerva overwhelmed him with the climax of her story, a
      little, rosy, elderly gentleman, with a round face, a sweet smile, and a
      curly gray head, walked into the room, accompanied by two girls. Persons
      of small importance&mdash;only Mr. Gallilee and his daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye-do, Mr. Le Frank. I hope you got plenty of money by the concert.
      I gave away my own two tickets. You will excuse me, I&rsquo;m sure. Music, I
      can&rsquo;t think why, always sends me to sleep. Here are your two pupils, Miss
      Minerva, safe and sound. It struck me we were rather in the way, when that
      sweet young creature was brought home. Sadly in want of quiet, poor thing&mdash;not
      in want of <i>us.</i> Mrs. Gallilee and Ovid, so clever and attentive,
      were just the right people in the right place. So I put on my hat&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      always available, Mr. Le Frank; I have the great advantage of never having
      anything to do&mdash;and I said to the girls, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a walk.&rsquo; We had
      no particular place to go to&mdash;that&rsquo;s another advantage of mine&mdash;so
      we drifted about. I didn&rsquo;t mean it, but, somehow or other, we stopped at a
      pastry-cook&rsquo;s shop. What was the name of the pastry-cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far Mr. Gallilee proceeded, speaking in the oddest self-contradictory
      voice, if such a description is permissible&mdash;a voice at once high in
      pitch and mild in tone: in short, as Mr. Le Frank once professionally
      remarked, a soft falsetto. When the good gentleman paused to make his
      little effort of memory, his eldest daughter&mdash;aged twelve, and always
      ready to distinguish herself&mdash;saw her opportunity, and took the rest
      of the narrative into her own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Maria, named after her mother, was one of the successful new products
      of the age we live in&mdash;the conventionally-charming child (who has
      never been smacked); possessed of the large round eyes that we see in
      pictures, and the sweet manners and perfect principles that we read of in
      books. She called everybody &ldquo;dear;&rdquo; she knew to a nicety how much oxygen
      she wanted in the composition of her native air; and&mdash;alas, poor
      wretch!&mdash;she had never wetted her shoes or dirtied her face since the
      day when she was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Miss Minerva,&rdquo; said Maria, &ldquo;the pastry-cook&rsquo;s name was Timbal. We
      have had ices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mind being now set at rest on the subject of the pastry-cook, Mr.
      Gallilee turned to his youngest daughter&mdash;aged ten, and one of the
      unsuccessful products of the age we live in. This was a curiously slow,
      quaint, self-contained child; the image of her father, with an occasional
      reflection of his smile; incurably stupid, or incurably perverse&mdash;the
      friends of the family were not quite sure which. Whether she might have
      been over-crammed with useless knowledge, was not a question in connection
      with the subject which occurred to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouse yourself, Zo,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallilee. &ldquo;What did we have besides ices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoe (known to her father, by vulgar abbreviation, as &ldquo;Zo&rdquo;) took Mr.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s stumpy red hand, and held hard by it as if that was the one way
      in which a dull child could rouse herself, with a prospect of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had so many of them,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Ask Maria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria responded with the sweetest readiness. &ldquo;Dear Zoe, you are so slow!
      Cheesecakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee patted Zoe&rsquo;s head as encouragingly as if she had discovered
      the right answer by herself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;ices and cheese-cakes,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;We tried cream-ice, and then we tried water-ice. The children,
      Miss Minerva, preferred the cream-ice. And, do you know, I&rsquo;m of their
      opinion. There&rsquo;s something in a cream-ice&mdash;what do you think yourself
      of cream-ices, Mr. Le Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one among the many weaknesses of Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s character to be
      incapable of opening his lips without, sooner or later, taking somebody
      into his confidence. In the merest trifles, he instinctively invited
      sympathy and agreement from any person within his reach&mdash;from a total
      stranger quite as readily as from an intimate friend. Mr. Le Frank,
      representing the present Court of Social Appeal, attempted to deliver
      judgment on the question of ices, and was interrupted without ceremony by
      Miss Minerva. She, too, had been waiting her opportunity to speak, and she
      now took it&mdash;not amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all possible respect, Mr. Gallilee, I venture to entreat that you
      will be a little more thoughtful, where the children are concerned. I beg
      your pardon, Mr. Le Frank, for interrupting you&mdash;but it is really a
      little too hard on Me. I am held responsible for the health of these
      girls; I am blamed over and over again, when it is not my fault, for
      irregularities in their diet&mdash;and there they are, at this moment,
      chilled with ices and cloyed with cakes! What will Mrs. Gallilee say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell her,&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls will be thirsty for the rest of the evening,&rdquo; Miss Minerva
      persisted; &ldquo;the girls will have no appetite for the last meal before
      bedtime. And their mother will ask Me what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good creature,&rdquo; cried Mr. Gallilee, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid of the girls&rsquo; 
      appetites! Take off their hats, and give them something nice for supper.
      They inherit my stomach, Miss Minerva&mdash;and they&rsquo;ll &lsquo;tuck in,&rsquo; as we
      used to say at school. Did they say so in your time, Mr. Le Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s governess and vulgar expressions were anomalies never to
      be reconciled, under any circumstances. Miss Minerva took off the hats in
      stern silence. Even &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; might have seen the contempt in her face, if
      she had not managed to hide it in this way, by means of the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that ensued, Mr. Le Frank had his chance of speaking, and
      showed himself to be a gentleman with a happily balanced character&mdash;a
      musician, with an eye to business. Using gratitude to Mr. Gallilee as a
      means of persuasion, he gently pushed the interests of a friend who was
      giving a concert next week. &ldquo;We poor artists have our faults, my dear sir;
      but we are all earnest in helping each other. My friend sang for nothing
      at my concert. Don&rsquo;t suppose for a moment that he expects it of me! But I
      am going to play for nothing at his concert. May I appeal to your kind
      patronage to take two tickets?&rdquo; The reply ended appropriately in musical
      sound&mdash;a golden tinkling, in Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having paid his tribute to art and artists, Mr. Gallilee looked furtively
      at Miss Minerva. On the wise principle of letting well alone, he perceived
      that the happy time had arrived for leaving the room. How was he to make
      his exit? He prided himself on his readiness of resource, in difficulties
      of this sort, and he was equal to the occasion as usual&mdash;he said he
      would go to his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We really have a capital smoking-room at that club,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do like
      a good cigar; and&mdash;what do <i>you</i> think Mr. Le Frank?&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      a pint of champagne nice drinking, this hot weather? Just cooled with ice&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know whether you feel the weather, Miss Minerva, as I do?&mdash;and
      poured, fizzing, into a silver mug. Lord, how delicious! Good-bye, girls.
      Give me a kiss before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria led the way, as became the elder. She not only gave the kiss, but
      threw an appropriate sentiment into the bargain. &ldquo;I do love you, dear
      papa!&rdquo; said this perfect daughter&mdash;with a look in Miss Minerva&rsquo;s
      direction, which might have been a malicious look in any eyes but Maria&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee turned to his youngest child. &ldquo;Well, Zo&mdash;what do <i>you</i>
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo took her father&rsquo;s hand once more, and rubbed her head against it like a
      cat. This new method of expressing filial affection seemed to interest Mr.
      Gallilee. &ldquo;Does your head itch, my dear?&rdquo; he asked. The idea was new to
      Zo. She brightened, and looked at her father with a sly smile. &ldquo;Why do you
      do it?&rdquo; Miss Minerva asked sharply. Zo clouded over again, and answered,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee rewarded her with a kiss, and went away to
      champagne and the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank left the schoolroom next. He paid the governess the
      compliment of reverting to her narrative of events at the concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am greatly struck,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by what you told me about Mr. Ovid Vere.
      We may, perhaps, have misjudged him in thinking that he doesn&rsquo;t like
      music. His coming to my concert suggests a more cheering view. Do you
      think there would be any impropriety in my calling to thank him? Perhaps
      it would be better if I wrote, and enclosed two tickets for my friend&rsquo;s
      concert? To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;ve pledged myself to dispose of a
      certain number of tickets. My friend is so much in request&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      expecting too much to ask him to sing for nothing. I think I&rsquo;ll write.
      Good-evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left alone with her pupils, Miss Minerva looked at her watch. &ldquo;Prepare
      your lessons for to-morrow,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls produced their books. Maria&rsquo;s library of knowledge was in
      perfect order. The pages over which Zo pondered in endless perplexity were
      crumpled by weary fingers, and stained by frequent tears. Oh, fatal
      knowledge! mercifully forbidden to the first two of our race, who shall
      count the crimes and stupidities committed in your name?
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva leaned back in her easy-chair. Her mind was occupied by the
      mysterious question of Ovid&rsquo;s presence at the concert. She raised her
      keenly penetrating eyes to the ceiling, and listened for sounds from
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she thought to herself, &ldquo;what they are doing upstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee was as complete a mistress of the practice of domestic
      virtue as of the theory of acoustics and fainting fits. At dressing with
      taste, and ordering dinners with invention; at heading her table
      gracefully, and making her guests comfortable; at managing refractory
      servants and detecting dishonest tradespeople, she was the equal of the
      least intellectual woman that ever lived. Her preparations for the
      reception of her niece were finished in advance, without an oversight in
      the smallest detail. Carmina&rsquo;s inviting bedroom, in blue, opened into
      Carmina&rsquo;s irresistible sitting-room, in brown. The ventilation was
      arranged, the light and shade were disposed, the flowers were attractively
      placed, under Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s infallible superintendence. Before Carmina
      had recovered her senses she was provided with a second mother, who played
      the part to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four persons, now assembled in the pretty sitting-room upstairs, were
      in a position of insupportable embarrassment towards each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding her son at a concert (after he had told her that he hated music)
      Mrs. Gallilee, had first discovered him hurrying to the assistance of a
      young lady in a swoon, with all the anxiety and alarm which he might have
      shown in the case of a near and dear friend. And yet, when this stranger
      was revealed as a relation, he had displayed an amazement equal to her
      own! What explanation could reconcile such contradictions as these?
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Carmina, her conduct complicated the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was she doing at a concert, when she ought to have been on her way to
      her aunt&rsquo;s house? Why, if she must faint when the hot room had not
      overpowered anyone else, had she failed to recover in the usual way? There
      she lay on the sofa, alternately flushing and turning pale when she was
      spoken to; ill at ease in the most comfortable house in London; timid and
      confused under the care of her best friends. Making all allowance for a
      sensitive temperament, could a long journey from Italy, and a childish
      fright at seeing a dog run over, account for such a state of things as
      this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Annoyed and perplexed&mdash;but yet far too prudent to commit herself
      ignorantly to inquiries which might lead to future embarrassment&mdash;Mrs.
      Gallilee tried suggestive small talk as a means of enlightenment. The
      wrinkled duenna, sitting miserably on satin supported by frail gilt legs,
      seemed to take her tone of feeling from her young mistress, exactly as she
      took her orders. Mrs. Gallilee spoke to her in English, and spoke to her
      in Italian&mdash;and could make nothing of the experiment in either case.
      The wild old creature seemed to be afraid to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid himself proved to be just as difficult to fathom, in another way
    </p>
    <p>
      He certainly answered when his mother spoke to him, but always briefly,
      and in the same absent tone. He asked no questions, and offered no
      explanations. The sense of embarrassment, on his side, had produced
      unaccountable changes. He showed the needful attention to Carmina, with a
      silent gentleness which presented him in a new character. His customary
      manner with ailing persons, women as well as men, was rather abrupt: his
      quick perception hurried him into taking the words out of their mouths
      (too pleasantly to give offence) when they were describing their symptoms.
      There he sat now, contemplating his pale little cousin, with a patient
      attention wonderful to see; listening to the commonplace words which
      dropped at intervals from her lips, as if&mdash;in his state of health,
      and with the doubtful prospect which it implied&mdash;there were no
      serious interests to occupy his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee could endure it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had not deliberately starved her imagination, and emptied her heart
      of any tenderness of feeling which it might once have possessed, her son&rsquo;s
      odd behaviour would have interested instead of perplexing her. As it was,
      her scientific education left her as completely in the dark, where
      questions of sentiment were concerned, as if her experience of humanity,
      in its relation to love, had been experience in the cannibal islands. She
      decided on leaving her niece to repose, and on taking her son away with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your present state of health, Ovid,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;Carmina must not
      accept your professional advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in those words stung Ovid&rsquo;s temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My professional advice?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You talk as if she was seriously
      ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s sweet smile stopped him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what may happen,&rdquo; she said, playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid <i>that</i> should happen!&rdquo; He spoke so fervently that the
      women all looked at him in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee turned to her niece, and proceeded quietly with what she had
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ovid is so sadly overworked, my dear, that I actually rejoice in his
      giving up practice, and going away from us to-morrow. We will leave you
      for the present with your old friend. Pray ring, if you want anything.&rdquo;
       She kissed her hand to Carmina, and, beckoning to her son, advanced
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa looked at her, and suddenly looked away again. Mrs. Gallilee
      stopped on her way out, at a chiffonier, and altered the arrangement of
      some of the china on it. The duenna followed on tiptoe&mdash;folded her
      thumb and two middle fingers into the palm of her hand&mdash;and,
      stretching out the forefinger and the little finger, touched Mrs. Gallilee
      on the back, so softly that she was unaware of it. &ldquo;The Evil Eye,&rdquo; Teresa
      whispered to herself in Italian, as she stole back to her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid lingered near his cousin: neither of them had seen what Teresa had
      done. He rose reluctantly to go. Feeling his little attentions gratefully,
      Carmina checked him with innocent familiarity as he left his chair. &ldquo;I
      must thank you,&rdquo; she said, simply; &ldquo;it seems hard indeed that you, who
      cure others, should suffer from illness yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa, watching them with interest, came a little nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could now examine Ovid&rsquo;s face with close and jealous scrutiny. Mrs.
      Gallilee reminded her son that she was waiting for him. He had some last
      words yet to say. The duenna drew back from the sofa, still looking at
      Ovid: she muttered to herself, &ldquo;Holy Teresa, my patroness, show me that
      man&rsquo;s soul in his face!&rdquo; At last, Ovid took his leave. &ldquo;I shall call and
      see how you are to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before I go.&rdquo; He nodded kindly to
      Teresa. Instead of being satisfied with that act of courtesy, she wanted
      something more. &ldquo;May I shake hands?&rdquo; she asked. Mrs. Gallilee was a
      Liberal in politics; never had her principles been tried, as they were
      tried when she heard those words. Teresa wrung Ovid&rsquo;s hand with tremulous
      energy&mdash;still intent on reading his character in his face. He asked
      her, smiling, what she saw to interest her. &ldquo;A good man, I hope,&rdquo; she
      answered, sternly. Carmina and Ovid were amused. Teresa rebuked them, as
      if they had been children. &ldquo;Laugh at some fitter time,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Descending the stairs, Mrs. Gallilee and Ovid met the footman. &ldquo;Mr. Mool
      is in the library, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the man said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to do, Ovid, for the next half-hour?&rdquo; his mother asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to see Mr. Mool? If it&rsquo;s law-business, I am afraid I shall
      not be of much use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lawyer is here by appointment, with a copy of your late uncle&rsquo;s
      Will,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee answered. &ldquo;You may have some interest in it. I think
      you ought to hear it read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid showed no inclination to adopt this proposal. He asked an idle
      question. &ldquo;I heard of their finding the Will&mdash;are there any romantic
      circumstances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee surveyed her son with an expression of good-humoured
      contempt. &ldquo;What a boy you are, in some things! Have you been reading a
      novel lately? My dear, when the people in Italy made up their minds, at
      last, to have the furniture in your uncle&rsquo;s room taken to pieces, they
      found the Will. It had slipped behind a drawer, in a rotten old cabinet,
      full of useless papers. Nothing romantic (thank God!), and nothing (as Mr.
      Mool&rsquo;s letter tells me) that can lead to misunderstandings or disputes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid&rsquo;s indifference was not to be conquered. He left it to his mother to
      send him word if he had a legacy &ldquo;I am not as much interested in it as you
      are,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Plenty of money left to you, of course?&rdquo; He was
      evidently thinking all the time of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee stopped in the hall, with an air of downright alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mind is in a dreadful state,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you really forgotten what I told you, only yesterday? The Will
      appoints me Carmina&rsquo;s guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had plainly forgotten it&mdash;he started, when his mother recalled the
      circumstance. &ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;that I was not reminded of
      it, when I saw Carmina&rsquo;s rooms prepared for her.&rdquo; His mother, anxiously
      looking at him, observed that his face brightened when he spoke of
      Carmina. He suddenly changed his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make allowances for an overworked man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are quite right. I
      ought to hear the Will read&mdash;I am at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Mrs. Gallilee now drew the right inference at last. She made no
      remark. Something seemed to move feebly under her powder and paint. Soft
      emotion trying to find its way to the surface? Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the library together, Miss Minerva returned to the
      schoolroom. She had lingered on the upper landing, and had heard the
      conversation between mother and son.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The library at Fairfield Gardens possessed two special attractions,
      besides the books. It opened into a large conservatory; and it was adorned
      by an admirable portrait of Mrs. Gallilee, painted by her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting the appearance of the fair original, Mr. Mool looked at the
      portrait, and then mentally reviewed the history of Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s
      family. What he did next, no person acquainted with the habits of lawyers
      will be weak enough to believe. Mr. Mool blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this the language of exaggeration, describing a human anomaly on the
      roll of attorneys? The fact shall be left to answer the question. Mr. Mool
      had made a mistake in his choice of a profession. The result of the
      mistake was&mdash;a shy lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attended by such circumstances as these, the history of the family
      assumes, for the moment, a certain importance. It is connected with a
      blushing attorney. It will explain what happened on the reading of the
      Will. And it is sure beforehand of a favourable reception&mdash;for it is
      all about money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Robert Graywell began life as the son of a small farmer. He was
      generally considered to be rather an eccentric man; but prospered,
      nevertheless, as a merchant in the city of London. When he retired from
      business, he possessed a house and estate in the country, and a handsome
      fortune safely invested in the Funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      His children were three in number:&mdash;his son Robert, and his daughters
      Maria and Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of his wife, to whom he was devotedly attached, was the first
      serious calamity of his life. He retired to his estate a soured and broken
      man. Loving husbands are not always, as a necessary consequence, tender
      fathers. Old Robert&rsquo;s daughters afforded him no consolation on their
      mother&rsquo;s death. Their anxiety about their mourning dresses so disgusted
      him that he kept out of their way. No extraordinary interest was connected
      with their prospects in life: they would be married&mdash;and there would
      be an end of them. As for the son, he had long since placed himself beyond
      the narrow range of his father&rsquo;s sympathies. In the first place, his
      refusal to qualify himself for a mercantile career had made it necessary
      to dispose of the business to strangers. In the second place, young Robert
      Graywell proved&mdash;without any hereditary influence, and in the face of
      the strongest discouragement&mdash;to be a born painter! One of the
      greatest artists of that day saw the boy&rsquo;s first efforts, and pronounced
      judgment in these plain words: &ldquo;What a pity he has not got his bread to
      earn by his brush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the death of old Robert, his daughters found themselves (to use their
      own expression) reduced to a trumpery legacy of ten thousand pounds each.
      Their brother inherited the estate, and the bulk of the property&mdash;not
      because his father cared about founding a family, but because the boy had
      always been his mother&rsquo;s favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the three children to marry was the eldest sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria considered herself fortunate in captivating Mr. Vere&mdash;a man of
      old family, with a high sense of what he owed to his name. He had a
      sufficient income, and he wanted no more. His wife&rsquo;s dowry was settled on
      herself. When he died, he left her a life-interest in his property
      amounting to six hundred a year. This, added to the annual proceeds of her
      own little fortune, made an income of one thousand pounds. The remainder
      of Mr. Vere&rsquo;s property was left to his only surviving child, Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a thousand a year for herself, and with two thousand a year for her
      son, on his coming of age, the widowed Maria might possibly have been
      satisfied&mdash;but for the extraordinary presumption of her younger
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan, ranking second in age, ranked second also in beauty; and yet, in
      the race for a husband, Susan won the prize!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after her sister&rsquo;s marriage, she made a conquest of a Scotch
      nobleman, possessed of a palace in London, and a palace in Scotland, and a
      rent-roll of forty thousand pounds. Maria, to use her own expression,
      never recovered it. From the horrid day when Susan became Lady Northlake,
      Maria became a serious woman. All her earthly interests centred now in the
      cultivation of her intellect. She started on that glorious career, which
      associated her with the march of science. In only a year afterwards&mdash;as
      an example of the progress which a resolute woman can make&mdash;she was
      familiar with zoophyte fossils, and had succeeded in dissecting the
      nervous system of a bee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there no counter-attraction in her married life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Very little. Mr. Vere felt no sympathy with his wife&rsquo;s scientific
      pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her husband&rsquo;s death, did she find no consolation in her son? Let her
      speak for herself. &ldquo;My son fills my heart. But the school, the university,
      and the hospital have all in turn taken his education out of my hands. My
      mind must be filled, as well as my heart.&rdquo; She seized her exquisite
      instruments, and returned to the nervous system of the bee.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time, Mr. John Gallilee&mdash;&ldquo;drifting about,&rdquo; as he said of
      himself&mdash;drifted across the path of science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widowed Mrs. Vere (as exhibited in public) was still a fine woman. Mr.
      Gallilee admired &ldquo;that style&rdquo;; and Mr. Gallilee had fifty thousand pounds.
      Only a little more, to my lord and my lady, than one year&rsquo;s income. But,
      invested at four percent, it added an annual two thousand pounds to Mrs.
      Vere&rsquo;s annual one thousand. Result, three thousand a year, encumbered with
      Mr. Gallilee. On reflection, Mrs. Vere accepted the encumbrance&mdash;and
      reaped her reward. Susan was no longer distinguished as the sister who had
      her dresses made in Paris; and Mrs. Gallilee was not now subjected to the
      indignity of getting a lift in Lady Northlake&rsquo;s carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the history of Robert, during this interval of time? In two
      words, Robert disgraced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking possession of his country house, the new squire was invited to
      contribute towards the expense of a pack of hounds kept by subscription in
      the neighbourhood, and was advised to make acquaintance with his
      fellow-sportsmen by giving a hunt-breakfast. He answered very politely;
      but the fact was not to be concealed&mdash;the new man refused to
      encourage hunting: he thought that noble amusement stupid and cruel. For
      the same reason, he refused to preserve game. A last mistake was left to
      make, and he made it. After returning the rector&rsquo;s visit, he failed to
      appear at church. No person with the smallest knowledge of the English
      character, as exhibited in an English county, will fail to foresee that
      Robert&rsquo;s residence on his estate was destined to come, sooner or later, to
      an untimely end. When he had finished his sketches of the picturesque
      aspects of his landed property, he disappeared. The estate was not
      entailed. Old Robert&mdash;who had insisted on the minutest formalities
      and details in providing for his dearly-loved wife&mdash;was impenetrably
      careless about the future of his children. &ldquo;My fortune has no value now in
      my eyes,&rdquo; he said to judicious friends; &ldquo;let them run through it all, if
      they please. It would do them a deal of good if they were obliged to earn
      their own living, like better people than themselves.&rdquo; Left free to take
      his own way, Robert sold the estate merely to get rid of it. With no
      expensive tastes, except the taste for buying pictures, he became a richer
      man than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their brother next communicated with them, Lady Northlake and Mrs.
      Gallilee heard of him as a voluntary exile in Italy. He was building a
      studio and a gallery; he was contemplating a series of pictures; and he
      was a happy man for the first time in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interval passed&mdash;and the sisters heard of Robert again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having already outraged the sense of propriety among his English
      neighbours, he now degraded himself in the estimation of his family, by
      marrying a &ldquo;model.&rdquo; The letter announcing this event declared, with
      perfect truth, that he had chosen a virtuous woman for his wife. She sat
      to artists, as any lady might sit to any artist, &ldquo;for the head only.&rdquo; Her
      parents gained a bare subsistence by farming their own little morsel of
      land; they were honest people&mdash;and what did brother Robert care for
      rank? His own grandfather had been a farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Northlake and Mrs. Gallilee felt it due to themselves to hold a
      consultation, on the subject of their sister-in-law. Was it desirable, in
      their own social interests, to cast Robert off from that moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan (previously advised by her kind-hearted husband) leaned to the side
      of mercy. Robert&rsquo;s letter informed them that he proposed to live, and die,
      in Italy. If he held to this resolution, his marriage would surely be an
      endurable misfortune to his relatives in London. &ldquo;Suppose we write to
      him,&rdquo; Susan concluded, &ldquo;and say we are surprised, but we have no doubt he
      knows best. We offer our congratulations to Mrs. Robert, and our sincere
      wishes for his happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Lady Northlake&rsquo;s astonishment, Mrs. Gallilee adopted this indulgent
      point of view, without a word of protest. She had her reasons&mdash;but
      they were not producible to a relative whose husband had forty thousand a
      year. Robert had paid her debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      An income of three thousand pounds, even in these days, represents a
      handsome competence&mdash;provided you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;owe a duty to society.&rdquo; In
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s position, an income of three thousand pounds represented
      genteel poverty. She was getting into debt again; and she was meditating
      future designs on her brother&rsquo;s purse. A charming letter to Robert was the
      result. It ended with, &ldquo;Do send me a photograph of your lovely wife!&rdquo; When
      the poor &ldquo;model&rdquo; died, not many years afterwards, leaving one little
      daughter, Mrs. Gallilee implored her brother to return to England. &ldquo;Come,
      dearest Robert, and find consolation and a home, under the roof of your
      affectionate Maria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Robert remained in Italy, and was buried in Italy. At the date of his
      death, he had three times paid his elder sister&rsquo;s debts. On every occasion
      when he helped her in this liberal way, she proved her gratitude by
      anticipating a larger, and a larger, and a larger legacy if she outlived
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing (as the family lawyer) what sums of money Mrs. Gallilee had
      extracted from her brother, Mr. Mool also knew that the advances thus made
      had been considered as representing the legacy, to which she might
      otherwise have had some sisterly claim. It was his duty to have warned her
      of this, when she questioned him generally on the subject of the Will; and
      he had said nothing about it, acting under a most unbecoming motive&mdash;in
      plain words, the motive of fear. From the self-reproachful feeling that
      now disturbed him, had risen that wonderful blush which made its
      appearance on Mr. Mool&rsquo;s countenance. He was actually ashamed of himself.
      After all, is it too much to have suggested that he was a human anomaly on
      the roll of attorneys?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee made her appearance in the library&mdash;and Mr. Mool&rsquo;s
      pulse accelerated its beat. Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s son followed her into the room&mdash;and
      Mr. Mool&rsquo;s pulse steadied itself again. By special arrangement with the
      lawyer, Ovid had been always kept in ignorance of his mother&rsquo;s affairs. No
      matter how angry she might be in the course of the next few minutes, she
      could hardly express her indignation in the presence of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyous anticipation has the happiest effect on female beauty. Mrs.
      Gallilee looked remarkably well, that day. Having rather a round and full
      face, she wore her hair (coloured from youthful nature) in a fringe across
      her forehead, balanced on either side by clusters of charming little
      curls. Her mourning for Robert was worthy of its Parisian origin; it
      showed to perfect advantage the bloom of her complexion and the whiteness
      of her neck&mdash;also worthy of their Parisian origin. She looked like a
      portrait of the period of Charles the Second, endowed with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you do, Mr. Mool? Have you been looking at my ferns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ferns were grouped at the entrance, leading from the library to the
      conservatory. They had certainly not escaped the notice of the lawyer, who
      possessed a hot-house of his own, and who was an enthusiast in botany. It
      now occurred to him&mdash;if he innocently provoked embarrassing results&mdash;that
      ferns might be turned to useful and harmless account as a means of
      introducing a change of subject. &ldquo;Even when she hasn&rsquo;t spoken a word,&rdquo;
       thought Mr. Mool, consulting his recollections, &ldquo;I have felt her eyes go
      through me like a knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare us the technicalities, please,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee continued, pointing
      to the documents on the table. &ldquo;I want to be exactly acquainted with the
      duties I owe to Carmina. And, by the way, I naturally feel some interest
      in knowing whether Lady Northlake has any place in the Will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee never said &ldquo;my sister,&rdquo; never spoke in the family circle of
      &ldquo;Susan.&rdquo; The inexhaustible sense of injury, aroused by that magnificent
      marriage, asserted itself in keeping her sister at the full distance
      implied by never forgetting her title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first legacy mentioned in the Will,&rdquo; said Mr. Mool, &ldquo;is a legacy to
      Lady Northlake.&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s face turned as hard as iron. &ldquo;One hundred
      pounds,&rdquo; Mr. Mool continued, &ldquo;to buy a mourning ring.&rdquo;&rsquo; Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s
      eyes became eloquent in an instant, and said as if in words, &ldquo;Thank
      Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So like your uncle&rsquo;s unpretending good sense,&rdquo; she remarked to her son.
      &ldquo;Any other legacy to Lady Northlake would have been simply absurd. Yes,
      Mr. Mool? Perhaps my name follows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool cast a side-look at the ferns. He afterwards described his
      sensations as reminding him of previous experience in a dentist&rsquo;s chair,
      at the awful moment when the operator says &ldquo;Let me look,&rdquo; and has his
      devilish instrument hidden in his hand. The &ldquo;situation,&rdquo; to use the
      language of the stage, was indeed critical enough already. Ovid added to
      the horror of it by making a feeble joke. &ldquo;What will you take for your
      chance, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before bad became worse, Mr. Mool summoned the energy of despair. He
      wisely read the exact words of the Will, this time: &ldquo;&lsquo;And I give and
      bequeath to my sister, Mrs. Maria Gallilee, one hundred pounds.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid&rsquo;s astonishment could only express itself in action. He started to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool went on reading. &ldquo;&lsquo;Free of legacy duty, to buy a mourning ring&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Ovid broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool finished the sentence. &ldquo;&lsquo;And my sister will understand the motive
      which animates me in making this bequest.&rdquo;&rsquo; He laid the Will on the table,
      and ventured to look up. At the same time, Ovid turned to his mother,
      struck by the words which had been just read, and eager to inquire what
      their meaning might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily for themselves, the two men never knew what the preservation of
      their tranquillity owed to that one moment of delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had looked at Mrs. Gallilee, when she was first aware of her
      position in the Will, they might have seen the incarnate Devil
      self-revealed in a human face. They might have read, in her eyes and on
      her lips, a warning hardly less fearful than the unearthly writing on the
      wall, which told the Eastern Monarch of his coming death. &ldquo;See this woman,
      and know what I can do with her, when she has repelled her guardian angel,
      and her soul is left to ME.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the revelation showed itself, and vanished. Her face was composed
      again, when her son and her lawyer looked at it. Her voice was under
      control; her inbred capacity for deceit was ready for action. All those
      formidable qualities in her nature, which a gentler and wiser training
      than hers had been might have held in check&mdash;by development of
      preservative influences that lay inert&mdash;were now driven back to their
      lurking-place; leaving only the faintest traces of their momentary
      appearance on the surface. Her breathing seemed to be oppressed; her
      eyelids drooped heavily&mdash;and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the room too hot for you?&rdquo; Ovid asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a harmless question, but any question annoyed her at that moment.
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she exclaimed irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The atmosphere of the conservatory is rich in reviving smells,&rdquo; Mr. Mool
      remarked. &ldquo;Do I detect, among the delightful perfumes which reach us, the
      fragrant root-stock of the American fern? If I am wrong, Mrs. Gallilee,
      may I send you some of the sweet-smelling Maidenhair from my own little
      hot-house?&rdquo; He smiled persuasively. The ferns were already justifying his
      confidence in their peace-making virtues, turned discreetly to account.
      Those terrible eyes rested on him mercifully. Not even a covert allusion
      to his silence in the matter of the legacy escaped her. Did the lawyer&rsquo;s
      artlessly abrupt attempt to change the subject warn her to be on her
      guard? In any case, she thanked him with the readiest courtesy for his
      kind offer. Might she trouble him in the meantime to let her see the Will?
    </p>
    <p>
      She read attentively the concluding words of the clause in which her name
      appeared&mdash;&ldquo;My sister will understand the motive which animates me in
      making this bequest&rdquo;&mdash;and then handed back the Will to Mr. Mool.
      Before Ovid could ask for it, she was ready with a plausible explanation.
      &ldquo;When your uncle became a husband and a father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;those claims
      on him were paramount. He knew that a token of remembrance (the smaller
      the better) was all I could accept, if I happened to outlive him. Please
      go on, Mr. Mool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one respect, Ovid resembled his late uncle. They both belonged to that
      high-minded order of men, who are slow to suspect, and therefore easy to
      deceive. Ovid tenderly took his mother&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have known it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without obliging you to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee did <i>not</i> blush. Mr. Mool did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee repeated. Mr. Mool looked at Ovid. &ldquo;The next name,
      Mr. Vere, is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does my uncle remember me as he has remembered my mother?&rdquo; asked Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;and let me tell you, a very pretty compliment is attached
      to the bequest. &lsquo;It is needless&rsquo; (your late uncle says) &lsquo;to leave any more
      important proof of remembrance to my nephew. His father has already
      provided for him; and, with his rare abilities, he will make a second
      fortune by the exercise of his profession.&rsquo; Most gratifying, Mrs.
      Gallilee, is it nor? The next clause provides for the good old housekeeper
      Teresa, and for her husband if he survives her, in the following terms&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee was becoming impatient to hear more of herself. &ldquo;We may, I
      think, pass over that,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;and get to the part of it which
      relates to Carmina and me. Don&rsquo;t think I am impatient; I am only desirous&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The growling of a dog in the conservatory interrupted her. &ldquo;That tiresome
      creature!&rdquo; she said sharply; &ldquo;I shall be obliged to get rid of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool volunteered to drive the dog out of the conservatory. Mrs.
      Gallilee, as irritable as ever, stopped him at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Mr. Mool! That dog&rsquo;s temper is not to be trusted. He shows it with
      Miss Minerva, my governess&mdash;growls just in that way whenever he sees
      her. I dare say he smells you. There! Now he barks! You are only making
      him worse. Come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being at the door, gentle Mr. Mool tried the ferns as peace-makers once
      more. He gathered a leaf, and returned to his place in a state of meek
      admiration. &ldquo;The flowering fern!&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A really fine specimen, Mrs. Gallilee, of the Osmunda Regalis. What a
      world of beauty in this bipinnate frond! One hardly knows where the stalk
      ends and the leaf begins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog, a bright little terrier, came trotting into the library He
      saluted the company briskly with his tail, not excepting Mr. Mool. No
      growl, or approach to a growl, now escaped him. The manner in which he
      laid himself down at Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s feet completely refuted her aspersion
      on his temper. Ovid suggested that he might have been provoked by a cat in
      the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mr. Mool turned over a page of the Will, and arrived at the
      clauses relating to Carmina and her guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be amiss,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;to mention, in the first place, that the
      fortune left to Miss Carmina amounts, in round numbers, to one hundred and
      thirty thousand pounds. The Trustees&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skip the Trustees,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the matter of the guardian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is a preliminary clause,
      in the event of your death or refusal to act, appointing Lady Northlake&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skip Lady Northlake,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are appointed Miss Carmina&rsquo;s guardian, until she comes of age,&rdquo; he
      resumed. &ldquo;If she marries in that interval&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to turn over a page. Not only Mrs. Gallilee, but Ovid also, now
      listened with the deepest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she marries in that interval, with her guardian&rsquo;s approval&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I don&rsquo;t approve of her choice?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid looked at his mother&mdash;and quickly looked away again. The
      restless little terrier caught his eye, and jumped up to be patted. Ovid
      was too pre-occupied to notice this modest advance. The dog&rsquo;s eyes and
      ears expressed reproachful surprise. His friend Ovid had treated him
      rudely for the first time in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the young lady contracts a matrimonial engagement of which you
      disapprove,&rdquo; Mr. Mool answered, &ldquo;you are instructed by the testator to
      assert your reasons in the presence of&mdash;well, I may describe it, as a
      family council; composed of Mr. Gallilee, and of Lord and Lady Northlake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excessively foolish of Robert,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee remarked. &ldquo;And what, Mr.
      Mool, is this meddling council of three to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A majority of the council, Mrs. Gallilee, is to decide the question
      absolutely. If the decision confirms your view, and if Miss Carmina still
      persists in her resolution notwithstanding&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to give way?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until your niece comes of age, ma&rsquo;am. Then, she decides for herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And inherits the fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an income from part of it&mdash;if her marriage is disapproved by
      her guardian and her relatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what becomes of the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Mool, &ldquo;will be invested by the Trustees, and
      will be divided equally, on her death, among her children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose she leaves no children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That case is provided for, ma&rsquo;am, by the last clause. I will only say
      now, that you are interested in the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee turned swiftly and sternly to her son. &ldquo;When I am dead and
      gone,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I look to you to defend my memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To defend your memory?&rdquo; Ovid repeated, wondering what she could possibly
      mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do become interested in the disposal of Robert&rsquo;s fortune&mdash;which
      God forbid!&mdash;can&rsquo;t you foresee what will happen?&rdquo; his mother inquired
      bitterly. &ldquo;Lady Northlake will say, &lsquo;Maria intrigued for this!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool looked doubtfully at the ferns. No! His vegetable allies were not
      strong enough to check any further outpouring of such family feeling as
      this. Nothing was to be trusted, in the present emergency, but the
      superior authority of the Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there are some further instructions, Mrs. Gallilee,
      which, as I venture to think, exhibit your late brother&rsquo;s well-known
      liberality of feeling in a very interesting light. They relate to the
      provision made for his daughter, while she is residing under your roof.
      Miss Carmina is to have the services of the best masters, in finishing her
      education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gallilee, with the utmost fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the use of a carriage to herself, whenever she may require it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Mool! <i>Two</i> carriages&mdash;in such a climate as this. One
      open, and one closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to defray these and other expenses, the Trustees are authorized to
      place at your disposal one thousand a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much! too much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool might have agreed with her&mdash;if he had nor known that Robert
      Graywell had thought of his sister&rsquo;s interests, in making this excessive
      provision for expenses incurred on his daughter&rsquo;s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, her dresses and her pocket money are included?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool smiled, and shook his head. &ldquo;Mr. Graywell&rsquo;s generosity has no
      limits,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where his daughter is concerned. Miss Carmina is to
      have five hundred a year for pocket-money and dresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee appealed to the sympathies of her son. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it touching?&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;Dear Carmina! my own people in Paris shall make her dresses.
      Well, Mr. Mool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to read the exact language of the Will next,&rdquo; Mr. Mool answered.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If her sweet disposition leads her into exceeding her allowance, in the
      pursuit of her own little charities, my Trustees are hereby authorized, at
      their own discretion, to increase the amount, within the limit of another
      five hundred pounds annually.&rsquo; It sounds presumptuous, perhaps, on my
      part,&rdquo; said Mr. Mool, venturing on a modest confession of enthusiasm, &ldquo;but
      one can&rsquo;t help thinking, What a good father! what a good child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee had another appropriate remark ready on her lips, when the
      unlucky dog interrupted her once more. He made a sudden rush into the
      conservatory, barking with all his might. A crashing noise followed the
      dog&rsquo;s outbreak, which sounded like the fall of a flower-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid hurried into the conservatory&mdash;with the dog ahead of him,
      tearing down the steps which led into the back garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pot lay broken on the tiled floor. Struck by the beauty of the flower
      that grew in it, he stooped to set it up again. If, instead of doing this,
      he had advanced at once to the second door, he would have seen a lady
      hastening into the house; and, though her back view only was presented, he
      could hardly have failed to recognize Miss Minerva. As it was, when he
      reached the door, the garden was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at the house, and saw Carmina at the open window of her
      bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sad expression on that sweet young face grieved him. Was she thinking
      of her happy past life? or of the doubtful future, among strangers in a
      strange country? She noticed Ovid&mdash;and her eyes brightened. His
      customary coldness with women melted instantly: he kissed his hand to her.
      She returned the salute (so familiar to her in Italy) with her gentle
      smile, and looked back into the room. Teresa showed herself at the window.
      Always following her impulses without troubling herself to think first,
      the duenna followed them now. &ldquo;We are dull up here,&rdquo; she called out. &ldquo;Come
      back to us, Mr. Ovid.&rdquo; The words had hardly been spoken before they both
      turned from the window. Teresa pointed significantly into the room. They
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid went back to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody listening?&rdquo; Mr. Mool inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not discovered anybody, but I doubt if a stray cat could have
      upset that heavy flower-pot.&rdquo; He looked round him as he made the reply.
      &ldquo;Where is my mother?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee had gone upstairs, eager to tell Carmina of the handsome
      allowance made to her by her father. Having answered in these terms, Mr.
      Mool began to fold up the Will&mdash;and suddenly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very inconsiderate, on my part,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I forgot, Mr. Ovid, that you
      haven&rsquo;t heard the end of it. Let me give you a brief abstract. You know,
      perhaps, that Miss Carmina is a Catholic? Very natural&mdash;her poor
      mother&rsquo;s religion. Well, sir, her good father forgets nothing. All
      attempts at proselytizing are strictly forbidden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid smiled. His mother&rsquo;s religious convictions began and ended with the
      inorganic matter of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last clause,&rdquo; Mr. Mool proceeded, &ldquo;seemed to agitate Mrs. Gallilee
      quite painfully. I reminded her that her brother had no near relations
      living, but Lady Northlake and herself. As to leaving money to my lady, in
      my lord&rsquo;s princely position&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; Ovid interposed, &ldquo;what is there to agitate my mother in
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool made his apologies for not getting sooner to the point, with the
      readiest good-will. &ldquo;Professional habit, Mr. Ovid,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We are
      apt to be wordy&mdash;paid, in fact, at so much a folio, for so many
      words!&mdash;and we like to clear the ground first. Your late uncle ends
      his Will, by providing for the disposal of his fortune, in two possible
      events, as follows: Miss Carmina may die unmarried, or Miss Carmina (being
      married) may die without offspring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the importance of the last clause now, Ovid stopped him again. &ldquo;Do
      I remember the amount of the fortune correctly?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Was it a
      hundred and thirty thousand pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what becomes of all that money, if Carmina never marries, or if she
      leaves no children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In either of those cases, sir, the whole of the money goes to Mrs.
      Gallilee and her daughters.&rdquo;&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time had advanced to midnight, after the reading of the Will&mdash;and
      Ovid was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of the quiet street in which he lived was only disturbed by
      the occasional rolling of carriage wheels, and by dance-music from the
      house of one of his neighbours who was giving a ball. He sat at his
      writing-table, thinking. Honest self-examination had laid out the state of
      his mind before him like a map, and had shown him, in its true
      proportions, the new interest that filled his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of that interest he was now the willing slave. If he had not known his
      mother to be with her, he would have gone back to Carmina when the lawyer
      left the house. As it was, he had sent a message upstairs, inviting
      himself to dinner, solely for the purpose of seeing Carmina again&mdash;and
      he had been bitterly disappointed when he heard that Mr. and Mrs. Gallilee
      were engaged, and that his cousin would take tea in her room. He had eaten
      something at this club, without caring what it was. He had gone to the
      Opera afterwards, merely because his recollections of a favourite
      singing-lady of that season vaguely reminded him of Carmina. And there he
      was, at midnight, on his return from the music, eager for the next
      opportunity of seeing his cousin, a few hours hence&mdash;when he had
      arranged to say good-bye at the family breakfast-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      To feel this change in him as vividly as he felt it, could lead to but one
      conclusion in the mind of a man who was incapable of purposely deceiving
      himself. He was as certain as ever of the importance of rest and change,
      in the broken state of his health. And yet, in the face of that
      conviction, his contemplated sea-voyage had already become one of the
      vanished illusions of his life!
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend had arranged to travel with him, that morning, from London to
      the port at which the yacht was waiting for them. They were hardly
      intimate enough to trust each other unreservedly with secrets. The
      customary apology for breaking an engagement was the alternative that
      remained. With the paper on his desk and with the words on his mind, he
      was yet in such a strange state of indecision that he hesitated to write
      the letter!
    </p>
    <p>
      His morbidly-sensitive nerves were sadly shaken. Even the familiar record
      of the half-hour by the hall clock startled him. The stroke of the bell
      was succeeded by a mild and mournful sound outside the door&mdash;the
      mewing of a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, without any appearance of surprise, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      With grace and dignity entered a small black female cat; exhibiting, by
      way of variety of colour, a melancholy triangular patch of white over the
      lower part of her face, and four brilliantly clean white paws. Ovid went
      back to his desk. As soon as he was in his chair again, the cat jumped on
      his shoulder, and sat there purring in his ear. This was the place she
      occupied, whenever her master was writing alone. Passing one day through a
      suburban neighbourhood, on his round of visits, the young surgeon had been
      attracted by a crowd in a by-street. He had rescued his present companion
      from starvation in a locked-up house, the barbarous inhabitants of which
      had gone away for a holiday, and had forgotten the cat. When Ovid took the
      poor creature home with him in his carriage, popular feeling decided that
      the unknown gentleman was &ldquo;a rum &lsquo;un.&rdquo; From that moment, this fortunate
      little member of a brutally-slandered race attached herself to her new
      friend, and to that friend only. If Ovid had owned the truth, he must have
      acknowledged that her company was a relief to him, in the present state of
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man&rsquo;s flagging purpose is in want of a stimulant, the most trifling
      change in the circumstances of the moment often applies the animating
      influence. Even such a small interruption as the appearance of his cat
      rendered this service to Ovid. To use the common and expressive phrase, it
      had &ldquo;shaken him up.&rdquo; He wrote the letter&mdash;and his patient companion
      killed the time by washing her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind being so far relieved, he went to bed&mdash;the cat following him
      upstairs to her bed in a corner of the room. Clothes are unwholesome
      superfluities not contemplated in the system of Nature. When we are
      exhausted, there is no such thing as true repose for us until we are freed
      from our dress. Men subjected to any excessive exertion&mdash;fighting,
      rowing, walking, working&mdash;must strip their bodies as completely as
      possible, or they are nor equal to the call on them. Ovid&rsquo;s knowledge of
      his own temperament told him that sleep was not to be hoped for, that
      night. But the way to bed was the way to rest notwithstanding, by getting
      rid of his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the sunrise he rose and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his letter with him, and dropped it into the box in his friend&rsquo;s
      door. The sooner he committed himself to the new course that he had taken,
      the more certain he might feel of not renewing the miserable and useless
      indecision of the past night. &ldquo;Thank God, that&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; he said to
      himself, as he heard the letter fall into the box, and left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking in the Park until he was weary, he sat down by the
      ornamental lake, and watched the waterfowl enjoying their happy lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever he went, whatever he did, Carmina was always with him. He had
      seen thousands of girls, whose personal attractions were far more
      remarkable&mdash;and some few among them whose manner was perhaps equally
      winning. What was the charm in the little half-foreign cousin that had
      seized on him in an instant, and that seemed to fasten its subtle hold
      more and more irresistibly with every minute of his life? He was content
      to feel the charm without caring to fathom it. The lovely morning light
      took him in imagination to her bedside; he saw here sleeping peacefully in
      her new room. Would the time come when she might dream of him? He looked
      at his watch. It was seven o&rsquo;clock. The breakfast-hour at Fairfield
      Gardens had been fixed for eight, to give him time to catch the morning
      train. Half an hour might be occupied in walking back to his own house.
      Add ten minutes to make some change in his dress&mdash;and he might set
      forth for his next meeting with Carmina. No uneasy anticipation of what
      the family circle might think of his sudden change of plan troubled his
      mind. A very different question occupied him. For the first time in his
      life, he wondered what dress a woman would wear at breakfast time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his house door with his own key. An elderly person, in a coarse
      black gown, was seated on the bench in the hall. She rose, and advanced
      towards him. In speechless astonishment, he confronted Carmina&rsquo;s faithful
      companion&mdash;Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, I want to speak to you,&rdquo; she said, in her best English.
      Ovid took her into his consulting-room. She wasted no time in apologies or
      explanations. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak!&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;Carmina has had a bad night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be at the house in half an hour!&rdquo; Ovid eagerly assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duenna shook her forefinger impatiently. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want a doctor.
      She wants a friend, when I am gone. What is her life here? A new life,
      among new people. Don&rsquo;t speak! She&rsquo;s frightened and miserable. So young,
      so shy, so easily startled. And I must leave her&mdash;I must! I must! My
      old man is failing fast; he may die, without a creature to comfort him, if
      I don&rsquo;t go back. I could tear my hair when I think of it. Don&rsquo;t speak!
      It&rsquo;s <i>my</i> business to speak. Ha! I know, what I know. Young doctor,
      you&rsquo;re in love with Carmina! I&rsquo;ve read you like a book. You&rsquo;re quick to
      see, sudden to feel&mdash;like one of my people. <i>Be</i> one of my
      people. Help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dragged a chair close to Ovid, and laid her hand suddenly and heavily
      on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault, mind; <i>I</i> have said nothing to disturb her. No!
      I&rsquo;ve made the best of it. I&rsquo;ve lied to her. What do I care? I would lie
      like Judas Iscariot himself to spare Carmina a moment&rsquo;s pain. It&rsquo;s such a
      new life for her&mdash;try to see it for yourself&mdash;such a new life.
      You and I shook hands yesterday. Do it again. Are you surprised to see me?
      I asked your mother&rsquo;s servants where you lived; and here I am&mdash;with
      the cruel teeth of anxiety gnawing me alive when I think of the time to
      come. Oh, my lamb! my angel! she&rsquo;s alone. Oh, my God, only seventeen years
      old, and alone in the world! No father, no mother; and soon&mdash;oh, too
      soon, too soon&mdash;not even Teresa! What are you looking at? What is
      there so wonderful in the tears of a stupid old fool? Drops of hot water.
      Ha! ha! if they fall on your fine carpet here, they won&rsquo;t hurt it. You&rsquo;re
      a good fellow; you&rsquo;re a dear fellow. Hush! I know the Evil Eye when I see
      it. No more of that! A secret in your ear&mdash;I&rsquo;ve said a word for you
      to Carmina already. Give her time; she&rsquo;s not cold; young and innocent,
      that&rsquo;s all. Love will come&mdash;I know, what I know&mdash;love will
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed&mdash;and, in the very act of laughing, changed again. Fright
      looked wildly at Ovid out of her staring eyes. Some terrifying remembrance
      had suddenly occurred to her. She sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you were going away,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You said it, when you left us
      yesterday. It can&rsquo;t be! it shan&rsquo;t be! You&rsquo;re not going to leave Carmina,
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid&rsquo;s first impulse was to tell the whole truth. He resisted the impulse.
      To own that Carmina was the cause of his abandonment of the sea-voyage,
      before she was even sure of the impression she had produced on him, would
      be to place himself in a position from which his self-respect recoiled.
      &ldquo;My plans are changed,&rdquo; was all he said to Teresa. &ldquo;Make your mind easy;
      I&rsquo;m not going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strange old creature snapped her fingers joyously. &ldquo;Good-bye! I want
      no more of you.&rdquo; With those cool and candid words of farewell, she
      advanced to the door&mdash;stopped suddenly to think&mdash;and came back.
      Only a moment had passed, and she was as sternly in earnest again as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I call you by your name?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Ovid! I may not see you again before I go back to my husband.
      This is my last word&mdash;never forget it. Even Carmina may have
      enemies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could she be thinking of? &ldquo;Enemies&mdash;in my mother&rsquo;s house!&rdquo; Ovid
      exclaimed. &ldquo;What can you possibly mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa returned to the door, and only answered him when she had opened it
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Evil Eye never lies,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wait&mdash;and you will see.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee was on her way to the breakfast-room, when her son entered
      the house. They met in the hall. &ldquo;Is your packing done?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in no humour to wait, and make his confession at that moment. &ldquo;Not
      yet,&rdquo; was his only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee led the way into the room. &ldquo;Ovid&rsquo;s luggage is not ready
      yet,&rdquo; she announced; &ldquo;I believe he will lose his train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all at the breakfast table, the children and the governess
      included. Carmina&rsquo;s worn face, telling its tale of a wakeful night,
      brightened again, as it had brightened at the bedroom window, when she saw
      Ovid. She took his hand frankly, and made light of her weary looks. &ldquo;No,
      my cousin,&rdquo; she said, playfully; &ldquo;I mean to be worthier of my pretty bed
      to-night; I am not going to be your patient yet.&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee (with this
      mouth full at the moment) offered good advice. &ldquo;Eat and drink as I do, my
      dear,&rdquo; he said to Carmina; &ldquo;and you will sleep as I do. Off I go when the
      light&rsquo;s out&mdash;flat on my back, as Mrs. Gallilee will tell you&mdash;and
      wake me if you can, till it&rsquo;s time to get up. Have some buttered eggs,
      Ovid. They&rsquo;re good, ain&rsquo;t they, Zo?&rdquo; Zo looked up from her plate, and
      agreed with her father, in one emphatic word, &ldquo;Jolly!&rdquo; Miss Minerva, queen
      of governesses, instantly did her duty. &ldquo;Zoe! how often must I tell you
      not to talk slang? Do you ever hear your sister say &lsquo;Jolly?&rsquo;&rdquo; That
      highly-cultivated child, Maria, strong in conscious virtue, added her
      authority in support of the protest. &ldquo;No young lady who respects herself,
      Zoe, will ever talk slang.&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee was unworthy of such a daughter.
      He muttered under his breath, &ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; Zo held out her plate for
      more. Mr. Gallilee was delighted. &ldquo;My child all over!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We
      are both of us good feeders. Zo will grow up a fine woman.&rdquo; He appealed to
      his stepson to agree with him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your medical opinion, Ovid, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s pretty smile passed like rippling light over her eyes and her
      lips. In her brief experience of England, Mr. Gallilee was the one
      exhilarating element in family life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s mind still dwelt on her son&rsquo;s luggage, and on the rigorous
      punctuality of railway arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your servant about?&rdquo; she said to Ovid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his business to see
      that you are ready in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to allow the false impression that prevailed to continue
      any longer. Ovid set them all right, in the plainest and fewest words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My servant is not to blame,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have written an apology to my
      friend&mdash;I am not going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, this astounding announcement was received in silent dismay&mdash;excepting
      the youngest member of the company. After her father, Ovid was the one
      other person in the world who held a place in Zo&rsquo;s odd little heart. Her
      sentiments were now expressed without hesitation and without reserve. She
      put down her spoon, and she cried, &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; Another exhibition of
      vulgarity. But even Miss Minerva was too completely preoccupied by the
      revelation which had burst on the family to administer the necessary
      reproof. Her eager eyes were riveted on Ovid. As for Mr. Gallilee, he held
      his bread and butter suspended in mid-air, and stared open-mouthed at his
      stepson, in helpless consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee always set the right example. Mrs. Gallilee was the first to
      demand an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this extraordinary proceeding mean?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid was impenetrable to the tone in which that question was put. He had
      looked at his cousin, when he declared his change of plan&mdash;and he was
      looking at her still. Whatever the feeling of the moment might be,
      Carmina&rsquo;s sensitive face expressed it vividly. Who could mistake the
      faintly-rising colour in her cheeks, the sweet quickening of light in her
      eyes, when she met Ovid&rsquo;s look? Still hardly capable of estimating the
      influence that she exercised over him, her sense of the interest taken in
      her by Ovid was the proud sense that makes girls innocently bold. Whatever
      the others might think of his broken engagement, her artless eyes said
      plainly, &ldquo;My feeling is happy surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee summoned her son to attend her, in no friendly voice. She,
      too, had looked at Carmina&mdash;and had registered the result of her
      observation privately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we to hear your reasons?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid had made the one discovery in the world, on which his whole heart was
      set. He was so happy, that he kept his mother out of his secret, with a
      masterly composure worthy of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a sea-voyage is the right thing for me,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a sudden change of opinion,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid coolly agreed with her. It <i>was</i> rather sudden, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governess still looked at him, wondering whether he would provoke an
      outbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little pause, Mrs. Gallilee accepted her son&rsquo;s short answer&mdash;with
      a sudden submission which had a meaning of its own. She offered Ovid
      another cup of tea; and, more remarkable yet, she turned to her eldest
      daughter, and deliberately changed the subject. &ldquo;What are your lessons, my
      dear, to-day?&rdquo; she asked, with bland maternal interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, bewildered Mr. Gallilee had finished his bread and butter.
      &ldquo;Ovid knows best, my dear,&rdquo; he said cheerfully to his wife. Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s sudden recovery of her temper did not include her husband. If a
      look could have annihilated that worthy man, his corporal presence must
      have vanished into air, when he had delivered himself of his opinion. As
      it was, he only helped Zo to another spoonful of jam. &ldquo;When Ovid first
      thought of that voyage,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I said, Suppose he&rsquo;s sick? A
      dreadful sensation isn&rsquo;t it, Miss Minerva? First you seem to sink into
      your shoes, and then it all comes up&mdash;eh? You&rsquo;re <i>not</i> sick at
      sea? I congratulate you! I most sincerely congratulate you! My dear Ovid,
      come and dine with me to-night at the club.&rdquo; He looked doubtfully at his
      wife, as he made that proposal. &ldquo;Got the headache, my dear? I&rsquo;ll take you
      out with pleasure for a walk. What&rsquo;s the matter with her, Miss Minerva?
      Oh, I see! Hush! Maria&rsquo;s going to say grace.&mdash;Amen! Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all rose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee was the first to open the door. The smoking-room at Fairfield
      Gardens was over the kitchen; he preferred enjoying his cigar in the
      garden of the Square. He looked at Carmina and Ovid, as if he wanted one
      of them to accompany him. They were both at the aviary, admiring the
      birds, and absorbed in their own talk. Mr. Gallilee resigned himself to
      his fate; appealing, on his way out, to somebody to agree with him as
      usual. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said with a little sigh, &ldquo;a cigar keeps one company.&rdquo;
       Miss Minerva (absorbed in her own thoughts) passed near him, on her way to
      the school-room with her pupils. &ldquo;You would find it so yourself, Miss
      Minerva&mdash;that is to say, if you smoked, which of course you don&rsquo;t. Be
      a good girl, Zo; attend to your lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo&rsquo;s perversity in the matter of lessons put its own crooked construction
      on this excellent advice. She answered in a whisper, &ldquo;Give us a holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The passing aspirations of idle minds, being subject to the law of
      chances, are sometimes fulfilled, and so exhibit poor human wishes in a
      consolatory light. Thanks to the conversation between Carmina and Ovid, Zo
      got her holiday after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee, still as amiable as ever, had joined her son and her niece
      at the aviary. Ovid said to his mother, &ldquo;Carmina is fond of birds. I have
      been telling her she may see all the races of birds assembled in the
      Zoological Gardens. It&rsquo;s a perfect day. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stupidest woman living would have understood what this proposal really
      meant. Mrs. Gallilee sanctioned it as composedly as if Ovid and Carmina
      had been brother and sister. &ldquo;I wish I could go with you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
      my household affairs fill my morning. And there is a lecture this
      afternoon, which I cannot possibly lose. I don&rsquo;t know, Carmina, whether
      you are interested in these things. We are to have the apparatus, which
      illustrates the conversion of radiant energy into sonorous vibrations.
      Have you ever heard, my dear, of the Diathermancy of Ebonite? Not in your
      way, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina looked as unintelligent as Zo herself. Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s science
      seemed to frighten her. The Diathermancy of Ebonite, by some
      incomprehensible process, drove her bewildered mind back on her old
      companion. &ldquo;I want to give Teresa a little pleasure before we part,&rdquo; she
      said timidly; &ldquo;may she go with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;And, now I think of it, why shouldn&rsquo;t
      the children have a little pleasure too? I will give them a holiday. Don&rsquo;t
      be alarmed, Ovid; Miss Minerva will look after them. In the meantime,
      Carmina, tell your good old friend to get ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina hastened away, and so helped Mrs. Gallilee to the immediate object
      which she had in view&mdash;a private interview with her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid anticipated a searching inquiry into the motives which had led him to
      give up the sea voyage. His mother was far too clever a woman to waste her
      time in that way. Her first words told him that his motive was as plainly
      revealed to her as the sunlight shining in at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a charming girl,&rdquo; she said, when Carmina closed the door behind
      her. &ldquo;Modest and natural&mdash;quite the sort of girl, Ovid, to attract a
      clever man like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid was completely taken by surprise, and owned it by his silence. Mrs.
      Gallilee went on in a tone of innocent maternal pleasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you began young,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;your first love was that poor
      little wizen girl of Lady Northlake&rsquo;s who died. Child&rsquo;s play, you will
      tell me, and nothing more. But, my dear, I am afraid I shall require some
      persuasion, before I quite sympathize with this new&mdash;what shall I
      call it?&mdash;infatuation is too hard a word, and &lsquo;fancy&rsquo; means nothing.
      We will leave it a blank. Marriages of cousins are debatable marriages, to
      say the least of them; and Protestant fathers and Papist mothers do
      occasionally involve difficulties with children. Not that I say, No. Far
      from it. But if this is to go on, I do hesitate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in his mother&rsquo;s tone grated on Ovid&rsquo;s sensibilities. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t at
      all follow you,&rdquo; he said, rather sharply; &ldquo;you are looking a little too
      far into the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will return to the present,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee replied&mdash;still
      with the readiest submission to the humour of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      On recent occasions, she had expressed the opinion that Ovid would do
      wisely&mdash;at his age, and with his professional prospects&mdash;to wait
      a few years before he thought of marrying. Having said enough in praise of
      her niece to satisfy him for the time being (without appearing to be
      meanly influenced, in modifying her opinion, by the question of money),
      her next object was to induce him to leave England immediately, for the
      recovery of his health. With Ovid absent, and with Carmina under her sole
      superintendence, Mrs. Gallilee could see her way to her own private ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;you ought to think seriously of change of air and
      scene. You know you would not allow a patient, in your present state of
      health, to trifle with himself as your are trifling now. If you don&rsquo;t like
      the sea, try the Continent. Get away somewhere, my dear, for your own
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only possible to answer this, in one way. Ovid owned that his
      mother was right and asked for time to think. To his infinite relief, he
      was interrupted by a knock at the door. Miss Minerva entered the room&mdash;not
      in a very amiable temper, judging by appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I disturb you,&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid seized the opportunity of retreat. He had some letters to write&mdash;he
      hurried away to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any mistake?&rdquo; the governess asked, when she and Mrs. Gallilee
      were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what respect, Miss Minerva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met your niece, ma&rsquo;am, on the stairs. She says you wish the children to
      have a holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to go with my son and Miss Carmina to the Zoological Gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Carmina said I was to go too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Carmina was perfectly right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governess fixed her searching eyes on Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;You really wish
      me to go with them?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the course of their experience, Mrs. Gallilee and Miss Minerva had once
      quarrelled fiercely&mdash;and Mrs. Gallilee had got the worst of it. She
      learnt her lesson. For the future she knew how to deal with her governess.
      When one said, &ldquo;I know why,&rdquo; the other only answered, &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it out plainly, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Miss Minerva proceeded. &ldquo;I am not to
      let Mr. Ovid&rdquo; (she laid a bitterly strong emphasis on the name, and
      flushed angrily)&mdash;&ldquo;I am not to let Mr. Ovid and Miss Carmina be alone
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a good guesser,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee remarked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Minerva more quietly still; &ldquo;I have only seen what you
      have seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I tell you what I have seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite needless, ma&rsquo;am. Your son is in love with his cousin. When am I to
      be ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bland mistress mentioned the hour. The rude governess left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee looked at the closing door with a curious smile. She had
      already suspected Miss Minerva of being crossed in love. The suspicion was
      now confirmed, and the man was discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soured by a hopeless passion,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;And the object is&mdash;my
      son.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On entering the Zoological Gardens, Ovid turned at once to the right,
      leading Carmina to the aviaries, so that she might begin by seeing the
      birds. Miss Minerva, with Maria in dutiful attendance, followed them.
      Teresa kept at a little distance behind; and Zo took her own erratic
      course, now attaching herself to one member of the little party, and now
      to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the aviaries the order of march became confused;
      differences in the birds made their appeal to differences in the taste of
      the visitors. Insatiably eager for useful information, that prize-pupil
      Maria held her governess captive at one cage; while Zo darted away towards
      another, out of reach of discipline, and good Teresa volunteered to bring
      her back. For a minute, Ovid and his cousin were left alone. He might have
      taken a lover&rsquo;s advantage even of that small opportunity. But Carmina had
      something to say to him&mdash;and Carmina spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Miss Minerva been your mother&rsquo;s governess for a long time?&rdquo; she
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some years,&rdquo; Ovid replied. &ldquo;Will you let me put a question on my
      side? Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina hesitated&mdash;and answered in a whisper, &ldquo;She looks
      ill-tempered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>is</i> ill-tempered,&rdquo; Ovid confessed. &ldquo;I suspect,&rdquo; he added with a
      smile, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t like Miss Minerva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina attempted no denial; her excuse was a woman&rsquo;s excuse all over:
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like <i>me.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been looking at her. Does she beat the children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Carmina! do you think she would be my mother&rsquo;s governess if she
      treated the children in that way? Besides, Miss Minerva is too well-bred a
      woman to degrade herself by acts of violence. Family misfortunes have very
      materially lowered her position in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was reminded, as he said those words, of the time when Miss Minerva had
      entered on her present employment, and when she had been the object of
      some little curiosity on his own part. Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s answer, when he
      once asked why she kept such an irritable woman in the house, had been
      entirely satisfactory, so far as she herself was concerned: &ldquo;Miss Minerva
      is remarkably well informed, and I get her cheap.&rdquo; Exactly like his
      mother! But it left Miss Minerva&rsquo;s motives involved in utter obscurity.
      Why had this highly cultivated woman accepted an inadequate reward for her
      services, for years together? Why&mdash;to take the event of that morning
      as another example&mdash;after plainly showing her temper to her employer,
      had she been so ready to submit to a suddenly decreed holiday, which
      disarranged her whole course of lessons for the week? Little did Ovid
      think that the one reconciling influence which adjusted these
      contradictions, and set at rest every doubt that grew out of them, was to
      be found in himself. Even the humiliation of watching him in his mother&rsquo;s
      interest, and of witnessing his devotion to another woman, was a sacrifice
      which Miss Minerva could endure for the one inestimable privilege of being
      in Ovid&rsquo;s company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Carmina could ask any more questions a shrill voice, at its highest
      pitch of excitement, called her away. Zo had just discovered the most
      amusing bird in the Gardens&mdash;the low comedian of the feathered race&mdash;otherwise
      known as the Piping Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina hurried to the cage as if she had been a child herself. Seeing
      Ovid left alone, the governess seized <i>her</i> chance of speaking to
      him. The first words that passed her lips told their own story. While
      Carmina had been studying Miss Minerva, Miss Minerva had been studying
      Carmina. Already, the same instinctive sense of rivalry had associated, on
      a common ground of feeling, the two most dissimilar women that ever
      breathed the breath of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your cousin know much about birds?&rdquo; Miss Minerva began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion which declares that vanity is a failing peculiar to the sex is
      a slander on women. All the world over, there are more vain men in it than
      vain women. If Ovid had not been one of the exceptions to a general rule
      among men, or even if his experience of the natures of women had been a
      little less limited, he too might have discovered Miss Minerva&rsquo;s secret.
      Even her capacity for self-control failed, at the moment when she took
      Carmina&rsquo;s place. Those keen black eyes, so hard and cold when they looked
      at anyone else&mdash;flamed with an all-devouring sense of possession when
      they first rested on Ovid. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mine. For one golden moment he&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;
       They spoke&mdash;and, suddenly, the every-day blind was drawn down again;
      there was nobody present but a well-bred woman, talking with delicately
      implied deference to a distinguished man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, we have not spoken of the birds,&rdquo; Ovid innocently answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you seemed to be both looking at them!&rdquo; She at once covered this
      unwary outbreak of jealousy under an impervious surface of compliment.
      &ldquo;Miss Carmina is not perhaps exactly pretty, but she is a singularly
      interesting girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid cordially (too cordially) agreed. Miss Minerva had presented her
      better self to him under a most agreeable aspect. She tried&mdash;struggled&mdash;fought
      with herself&mdash;to preserve appearances. The demon in her got
      possession again of her tongue. &ldquo;Do you find the young lady intelligent?&rdquo;
       she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only one word&mdash;spoken perhaps a little sharply. The miserable woman
      shrank under it. &ldquo;An idle question on my part,&rdquo; she said, with the
      pathetic humility that tries to be cheerful. &ldquo;And another warning, Mr.
      Vere, never to judge by appearances.&rdquo; She looked at him, and returned to
      the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid&rsquo;s eyes followed her compassionately. &ldquo;Poor wretch!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;What
      an infernal temper, and how hard she tries to control it!&rdquo; He joined
      Carmina, with a new delight in being near her again. Zo was still in
      ecstasies over the Piping Crow. &ldquo;Oh, the jolly little chap! Look how he
      cocks his head! He mocks me when I whistle. Buy him,&rdquo; cried Zo, tugging at
      Ovid&rsquo;s coat tails in the excitement that possessed her; &ldquo;buy him, and let
      me take him home with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some visitors within hearing began to laugh. Miss Minerva opened her lips;
      Maria opened her lips. To the astonishment of both of them the coming
      rebuke proved to be needless.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden transformation to silence and docility had made a new creature of
      Zo, before they could speak&mdash;and Ovid had unconsciously worked the
      miracle. For the first time in the child&rsquo;s experience, he had suffered his
      coat tails to be pulled without immediately attending to her. Who was he
      looking at? It was only too easy to see that Carmina had got him all to
      herself. The jealous little heart swelled in Zo&rsquo;s bosom. In silent
      perplexity she kept watch on the friend who had never disappointed her
      before. Little by little, her slow intelligence began to realise the
      discovery of something in his face which made him look handsomer than
      ever, and which she had never seen in it yet. They all left the aviaries,
      and turned to the railed paddocks in which the larger birds were
      assembled. And still Zo followed so quietly, so silently, that her elder
      sister&mdash;threatened with a rival in good behaviour&mdash;looked at her
      in undisguised alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incited by Maria (who felt the necessity of vindicating her character)
      Miss Minerva began a dissertation on cranes, suggested by the birds with
      the brittle-looking legs hopping up to her in expectation of something to
      eat. Ovid was absorbed in attending to his cousin; he had provided himself
      with some bread, and was helping Carmina to feed the birds. But one person
      noticed Zo, now that her strange lapse into good behaviour had lost the
      charm of novelty. Old Teresa watched her. There was something plainly
      troubling the child in secret; she had a mind to know what it might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo approached Ovid again, determined to understand the change in him if
      perseverance could do it. He was talking so confidentially to Carmina,
      that he almost whispered in her ear. Zo eyed him, without daring to touch
      his coat tails again. Miss Minerva tried hard to go on composedly with the
      dissertation on cranes. &ldquo;Flocks of these birds, Maria, pass periodically
      over the southern and central countries of Europe&rdquo;&mdash;Her breath failed
      her, as she looked at Ovid: she could say no more. Zo stopped those
      maddening confidences; Zo, in desperate want of information, tugged boldly
      at Carmina&rsquo;s skirts this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl turned round directly. &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With big tears of indignation rising in her eyes, Zo pointed to Ovid. &ldquo;I
      say!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is he going to buy the Piping Crow for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Zo&rsquo;s discomfiture they both smiled. She dried her eyes with her fists,
      and waited doggedly for an answer. Carmina set the child&rsquo;s mind at ease
      very prettily and kindly; and Ovid added the pacifying influence of a
      familiar pat on her cheek. Noticed at last, and satisfied that the bird
      was not to be bought for anybody, Zo&rsquo;s sense of injury was appeased; her
      jealousy melted away as the next result. After a pause&mdash;produced, as
      her next words implied, by an effort of memory&mdash;she suddenly took
      Carmina into her confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell!&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I saw another man look like Ovid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, dear?&rdquo; Carmina asked&mdash;meaning, at what past date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When his face was close to yours,&rdquo; Zo answered&mdash;meaning, under what
      recent circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid, hearing this reply, knew his small sister well enough to foresee
      embarrassing results if he allowed the conversation to proceed. He took
      Carmina&rsquo;s arm, and led her a little farther on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva obstinately followed them, with Maria in attendance, still
      imperfectly enlightened on the migration of cranes. Zo looked round, in
      search of another audience. Teresa had been listening; she was present,
      waiting for events. Being herself what stupid people call &ldquo;an oddity,&rdquo; her
      sympathies were attracted by this quaint child. In Teresa&rsquo;s opinion,
      seeing the animals was very inferior, as an amusement, to exploring Zo&rsquo;s
      mind. She produced a cake of chocolate, from a travelling bag which she
      carried with her everywhere. The cake was sweet, it was flavoured with
      vanilla, and it was offered to Zo, unembittered by advice not to be greedy
      and make herself ill. Staring hard at Teresa, she took an experimental
      bite. The wily duenna chose that propitious moment to present herself in
      the capacity of a new audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that other man you saw, who looked like Mr. Ovid?&rdquo; she asked;
      speaking in the tone of serious equality which is always flattering to the
      self-esteem of children in intercourse with elders. Zo was so proud of
      having her own talk reported by a grown-up stranger, that she even forgot
      the chocolate. &ldquo;I wanted to say more than that,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Would you
      like to hear the end of it?&rdquo; And this admirable foreign person answered,
      &ldquo;I should very much like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo hesitated. To follow out its own little train of thought, in words, was
      no easy task to the immature mind which Miss Minerva had so mercilessly
      overworked. Led by old Dame Nature (first of governesses!) Zo found her
      way out of the labyrinth by means of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Joseph?&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa had heard the footman called by his name: she knew who Joseph was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Matilda?&rdquo; Zo proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa had heard the housemaid called by her name: she knew who Matilda
      was. And better still, she helped her little friend by a timely guess at
      what was coming, presented under the form of a reminder. &ldquo;You saw Mr.
      Ovid&rsquo;s face close to Carmina&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo nodded furiously&mdash;the end of it was coming already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And before that,&rdquo; Teresa went on, &ldquo;you saw Joseph&rsquo;s face close to
      Matilda&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Joseph kiss Matilda!&rdquo; Zo burst out, with a scream of triumph. &ldquo;Why
      doesn&rsquo;t Ovid kiss Carmina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep bass voice, behind them, answered gravely: &ldquo;Because the governess
      is in the way.&rdquo; And a big bamboo walking-stick pointed over their heads at
      Miss Minerva. Zo instantly recognised the stick, and took it into her own
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa turned&mdash;and found herself in the presence of a remarkable man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first place, the stranger was almost tall enough to be shown as a
      giant; he towered to a stature of six feet six inches, English measure. If
      his immense bones had been properly covered with flesh, he might have
      presented the rare combination of fine proportions with great height. He
      was so miserably&mdash;it might almost be said, so hideously&mdash;thin
      that his enemies spoke of him as &ldquo;the living skeleton.&rdquo; His massive
      forehead, his great gloomy gray eyes, his protuberant cheek-bones,
      overhung a fleshless lower face naked of beard, whiskers, and moustache.
      His complexion added to the startling effect which his personal appearance
      produced on strangers. It was of the true gipsy-brown, and, being darker
      in tone than his eyes, added remarkably to the weird look, the dismal
      thoughtful scrutiny, which it was his habit to fix on persons talking with
      him, no matter whether they were worthy of attention or not. His straight
      black hair hung as gracelessly on either side of his hollow face as the
      hair of an American Indian. His great dusky hands, never covered by gloves
      in the summer time, showed amber-coloured nails on bluntly-pointed
      fingers, turned up at the tips. Those tips felt like satin when they
      touched you. When he wished to be careful, he could handle the frailest
      objects with the most exquisite delicacy. His dress was of the recklessly
      loose and easy kind. His long frock-coat descended below his knees; his
      flowing trousers were veritable bags; his lean and wrinkled throat turned
      about in a widely-opened shirt-collar, unconfined by any sort of neck-tie.
      He had a theory that a head-dress should be solid enough to resist a
      chance blow&mdash;a fall from a horse, or the dropping of a loose brick
      from a house under repair. His hard black hat, broad and curly at the
      brim, might have graced the head of a bishop, if it had not been
      secularised by a queer resemblance to the bell-shaped hat worn by dandies
      in the early years of the present century. In one word he was, both in
      himself and in his dress, the sort of man whom no stranger is careless
      enough to pass without turning round for a second look. Teresa, eyeing him
      with reluctant curiosity, drew back a step, and privately reviled him (in
      the secrecy of her own language) as an ugly beast! Even his name startled
      people by the outlandish sound of it. Those enemies who called him &ldquo;the
      living skeleton&rdquo; said it revealed his gipsy origin. In medical and
      scientific circles he was well and widely known as&mdash;Doctor Benjulia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo ran away with his bamboo stick. After a passing look of gloomy
      indifference at the duenna, he called to the child to come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed him in an oddly indirect way, as if she had been returning
      against her will. At the same time she looked up in his face, with an
      absence of shyness which showed, like the snatching away of his stick,
      that she was familiarly acquainted with him, and accustomed to take
      liberties. And yet there was an expression of uneasy expectation in her
      round attentive eyes. &ldquo;Do you want it back again?&rdquo; she asked, offering the
      stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. What would your mother say to me, if you tumbled over my
      big bamboo, and dashed out your brains on this hard gravel walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been to see Mama?&rdquo; Zo asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have <i>not</i> been to see Mama&mdash;but I know what she would say to
      me if you dashed out your brains, for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would say&mdash;Doctor Benjulia, your name ought to be Herod.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was Herod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herod was a Royal Jew, who killed little girls when they took away his
      walking-stick. Come here, child. Shall I tickle you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d say that,&rdquo; Zo answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When men in general thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of talking nonsense to
      children, they can no more help smiling than they can help breathing. The
      doctor was an extraordinary exception to this rule; his grim face never
      relaxed&mdash;not even when Zo reminded him that one of his favourite
      recreations was tickling her. She obeyed, however, with the curious
      appearance of reluctant submission showing itself once more. He put two of
      his soft big finger-tips on her spine, just below the back of her neck,
      and pressed on the place. Zo started and wriggled under his touch. He
      observed her with as serious an interest as if he had been conducting a
      medical experiment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how you make our dog kick with his leg,&rdquo; said
      Zo, recalling her experience of the doctor in the society of the dog. &ldquo;How
      do you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I touch the Cervical Plexus,&rdquo; Doctor Benjulia answered as gravely as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attempt at mystifying the child failed completely. Zo considered the
      unknown tongue in which he had answered her as being equivalent to
      lessons. She declined to notice the Cervical Plexus, and returned to the
      little terrier at home. &ldquo;Do you think the dog likes it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the dog. Do <i>you</i> like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Benjulia turned to Teresa. His gloomy gray eyes rested on her, as
      they might have rested on any inanimate object near him&mdash;on the
      railing that imprisoned the birds, or on the pipes that kept the
      monkey-house warm. &ldquo;I have been playing the fool, ma&rsquo;am, with this child,&rdquo;
       he said; &ldquo;and I fear I have detained you. I beg your pardon.&rdquo; He pulled
      off his episcopal hat, and walked grimly on, without taking any further
      notice of Zo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa made her best courtesy in return. The magnificent civility of the
      ugly giant daunted, while it flattered her. &ldquo;The manners of a prince,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;and the complexion of a gipsy. Is he a nobleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo answered, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a doctor,&rdquo;&mdash;as if that was something much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like him?&rdquo; Teresa inquired next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo answered the duenna as she had answered the doctor: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Ovid and his cousin had not been unobservant of what was
      passing at a little distance from them. Benjulia&rsquo;s great height, and his
      evident familiarity with the child, stirred Carmina&rsquo;s curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid seemed to be disinclined to talk of him. Miss Minerva made herself
      useful, with the readiest politeness. She mentioned his odd name, and
      described him as one of Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s old friends. &ldquo;Of late years,&rdquo; she
      proceeded, &ldquo;he is said to have discontinued medical practice, and devoted
      himself to chemical experiments. Nobody seems to know much about him. He
      has built a house in a desolate field&mdash;in some lost suburban
      neighbourhood that nobody can discover. In plain English, Dr. Benjulia is
      a mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this, Carmina appealed again to Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am asked riddles,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am never easy till the answer is
      guessed for me. And when I hear of mysteries, I am dying to have them
      revealed. You are a doctor yourself. Do tell me something more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid might have evaded her entreaties by means of an excuse. But her eyes
      were irresistible: they looked him into submission in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Benjulia is what we call a Specialist,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean that he
      only professes to treat certain diseases. Brains and nerves are Benjulia&rsquo;s
      diseases. Without quite discontinuing his medical practice, he limits
      himself to serious cases&mdash;when other doctors are puzzled, you know,
      and want him to help them. With this exception, he has certainly
      sacrificed his professional interests to his mania for experiments in
      chemistry. What those experiments are, nobody knows but himself. He keeps
      the key of his laboratory about him by day and by night. When the place
      wants cleaning, he does the cleaning with his own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina listened with great interest: &ldquo;Has nobody peeped in at the
      windows?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no windows&mdash;only a skylight in the roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t somebody get up on the roof, and look in through the skylight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid laughed. &ldquo;One of his men-servants is said to have tried that
      experiment,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did the servant see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A large white blind, drawn under the skylight, and hiding the whole room
      from view. Somehow, the doctor discovered him&mdash;and the man was
      instantly dismissed. Of course there are reports which explain the mystery
      of the doctor and his laboratory. One report says that he is trying to
      find a way of turning common metals into gold. Another declares that he is
      inventing some explosive compound, so horribly destructive that it will
      put an end to war. All I can tell you is, that his mind (when I happen to
      meet him) seems to be as completely absorbed as ever in brains and nerves.
      But, what they can have to do with chemical experiments, secretly pursued
      in a lonely field, is a riddle to which I have thus far found no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo; Carmina inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question seemed to amuse Ovid. &ldquo;If Doctor Benjulia had a wife, you
      think we might get at his secrets? There is no such chance for us&mdash;he
      manages his domestic affairs for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he even got a housekeeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even a housekeeper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was making that reply, he saw the doctor slowly advancing towards
      them. &ldquo;Excuse me for one minute,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;I will just speak to him,
      and come back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina turned to Miss Minerva in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ovid seems to have some reason for keeping the tall man away from us,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;Does he dislike Doctor Benjulia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for restraining motives, the governess might have gratified her hatred
      of Carmina by a sharp reply. She had her reasons&mdash;not only after what
      she had overheard in the conservatory, but after what she had seen in the
      Gardens&mdash;for winning Carmina&rsquo;s confidence, and exercising over her
      the influence of a trusted friend. Miss Minerva made instant use of her
      first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you what I have noticed myself,&rdquo; she said confidentially.
      &ldquo;When Mrs. Gallilee gives parties, I am allowed to be present&mdash;to see
      the famous professors of science. On one of these occasions they were
      talking of instinct and reason. Your cousin, Mr. Ovid Vere, said it was no
      easy matter to decide where instinct ended and reason began. In his own
      experience, he had sometimes found people of feeble minds, who judged by
      instinct, arrive at sounder conclusions than their superiors in
      intelligence, who judged by reason. The talk took another turn&mdash;and,
      soon after, Doctor Benjulia joined the guests. I don&rsquo;t know whether you
      have observed that Mr. Gallilee is very fond of his stepson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes! Carmina had noticed that. &ldquo;I like Mr. Gallilee,&rdquo; she said warmly;
      &ldquo;he is such a nice, kind-hearted, natural old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva concealed a sneer under a smile. Fond of Mr. Gallilee? what
      simplicity! &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;the doctor paid his respects to the
      master of the house, and then he shook hands with Mr. Ovid; and then the
      scientific gentlemen all got round him, and had learned talk. Mr. Gallilee
      came up to his stepson, looking a little discomposed. He spoke in a
      whisper&mdash;you know his way?&mdash;&lsquo;Ovid, do you like Doctor Benjulia?
      Don&rsquo;t mention it; I hate him.&rsquo; Strong language for Mr. Gallilee, wasn&rsquo;t
      it? Mr. Ovid said, &lsquo;Why do you hate him?&rsquo; And poor Mr. Gallilee answered
      like a child, &lsquo;Because I do.&rsquo; Some ladies came in, and the old gentleman
      left us to speak to them. I ventured to say to Mr. Ovid, &lsquo;Is that instinct
      or reason?&rsquo; He took it quite seriously. &lsquo;Instinct,&rsquo; he said&mdash;&lsquo;and it
      troubles me.&rsquo; I leave you, Miss Carmina, to draw your own conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both looked up. Ovid and the doctor were walking slowly away from
      them, and were just passing Teresa and the child. At the same moment, one
      of the keepers of the animals approached Benjulia. After they had talked
      together for a while, the man withdrew. Zo (who had heard it all, and had
      understood a part of it) ran up to Carmina, charged with news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sick monkey in the gardens, in a room all by himself!&rdquo; the
      child cried. &ldquo;And, I say, look there!&rdquo; She pointed excitedly to Benjulia
      and Ovid, walking on again slowly in the direction of the aviaries.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the big doctor who tickles me! He says he&rsquo;ll see the poor monkey,
      as soon as he&rsquo;s done with Ovid. And what do you think he said besides? He
      said perhaps he&rsquo;d take the monkey home with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s the matter with the poor creature?&rdquo; Carmina asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After what Mr. Ovid has told us, I think I know,&rdquo; Miss Minerva answered.
      &ldquo;Doctor Benjulia wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in the monkey unless it had a
      disease of the brain.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ovid had promised to return to Carmina in a minute. The minutes passed,
      and still Doctor Benjulia held him in talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he was no longer seeking amusement, in his own dreary way, by
      mystifying Zo, the lines seemed to harden in the doctor&rsquo;s fleshless face.
      A scrupulously polite man, he was always cold in his politeness. He waited
      to have his hand shaken, and waited to be spoken to. And yet, on this
      occasion, he had something to say. When Ovid opened the conversation, he
      changed the subject directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benjulia! what brings You to the Zoological Gardens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the monkeys has got brain disease; and they fancy I might like to
      see the beast before they kill him. Have you been thinking lately of that
      patient we lost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not at the moment remembering the patient, Ovid made no immediate reply.
      The doctor seemed to distrust his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you have forgotten the case?&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;We
      called it hysteria, not knowing what else it was. I don&rsquo;t forgive the girl
      for slipping through our fingers; I hate to be beaten by Death, in that
      way. Have you made up your mind what to do, on the next occasion? Perhaps
      you think you could have saved her life if you had been sent for, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I am just as ignorant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give ignorance time,&rdquo; Benjulia interposed, &ldquo;and ignorance will become
      knowledge&mdash;if a man is in earnest. The proper treatment might occur
      to you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held to his idea with such obstinacy that Ovid set him right, rather
      impatiently. &ldquo;The proper treatment has as much chance of occurring to the
      greatest ass in the profession,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;as it has of occurring to
      me. I can put my mind to no good medical use; my work has been too much
      for me. I am obliged to give up practice, and rest&mdash;for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not even a formal expression of sympathy escaped Doctor Benjulia. Having
      been a distrustful friend so far, he became an inquisitive friend now.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going away, of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where to? On the Continent? Not
      to Italy&mdash;if you really want to recover your health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the objection to Italy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor put his great hand solemnly on his young friend&rsquo;s shoulder.
      &ldquo;The medical schools in that country are recovering their past
      reputation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are becoming active centres of physiological
      inquiry. You will be dragged into it, to a dead certainty. They&rsquo;re sure to
      try what they can strike out by collision with a man like you. What will
      become of that overworked mind of yours, when a lot of professors are
      searching it without mercy? Have you ever been to Canada?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been everywhere. Canada is just the place for you, in this summer
      season. Bracing air; and steady-going doctors who leave the fools in
      Europe to pry into the secrets of Nature. Thousands of miles of land, if
      you like riding. Thousands of miles of water, if you like sailing. Pack
      up, and go to Canada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did all this mean? Was he afraid that his colleague might stumble on
      some discovery which he was in search of himself? And did the discovery
      relate to his own special subject of brains and nerves? Ovid made an
      attempt to understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something about yourself, Benjulia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you returning
      to your regular professional work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia struck his bamboo stick emphatically on the gravel-walk. &ldquo;Never!
      Unless I know more than I know now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This surely meant that he was as much devoted to his chemical experiments
      as ever? In that case, how could Ovid (who knew nothing of chemical
      experiments) be an obstacle in the doctor&rsquo;s way? Baffled thus far, he made
      another attempt at inducing Benjulia to explain himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is the world to hear of your discoveries?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s massive forehead gathered ominously into a frown, &ldquo;Damn the
      world!&rdquo; That was his only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid was not disposed to allow himself to be kept in the dark in this way.
      &ldquo;I suppose you are going on with your experiments?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gloom of Benjulia&rsquo;s grave eyes deepened: they stared with a stern
      fixedness into vacancy. His great head bent slowly over his broad breast.
      The whole man seemed to be shut up in himself. &ldquo;I go on a way of my own,&rdquo;
       he growled. &ldquo;Let nobody cross it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that reply, to persist in making inquiries would only have ended in
      needlessly provoking an irritable man. Ovid looked back towards Carmina.
      &ldquo;I must return to my friends,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor lifted his head, like a man awakened. &ldquo;Have I been rude?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about my experiments. That&rsquo;s my raw place, and
      you hit me on it. What did you say just now? Friends? who are your
      friends?&rdquo; He rubbed his hand savagely over his forehead&mdash;it was a way
      he had of clearing his mind. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I saw your friends
      just now. Who&rsquo;s the young lady?&rdquo; His most intimate companions had never
      heard him laugh: they had sometimes seen his thin-lipped mouth widen
      drearily into a smile. It widened now. &ldquo;Whoever she is,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;Zo
      wonders why you don&rsquo;t kiss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This specimen of Benjulia&rsquo;s attempts at pleasantry was not exactly to
      Ovid&rsquo;s taste. He shifted the topic to his little sister. &ldquo;You were always
      fond of Zo,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia looked thoroughly puzzled. Fondness for anybody was, to all
      appearance, one of the few subjects on which he had not qualified himself
      to offer an opinion. He gave his head another savage rub, and returned to
      the subject of the young lady. &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin,&rdquo; Ovid replied as shortly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin? A girl of Lady Northlake&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: my late uncle&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia suddenly came to a standstill. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;has that
      misbegotten child grown up to be a woman?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid started. Words of angry protest were on his lips, when he perceived
      Teresa and Zo on one side of him, and the keeper of the monkeys on the
      other. Benjulia dismissed the man, with the favourable answer which Zo had
      already reported. They walked on again. Ovid was at liberty to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you said of my cousin, just now?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone seemed to surprise the doctor. &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used a very offensive word. You called Carmina a &lsquo;misbegotten child.&rsquo; 
      Are you repeating some vile slander on the memory of her mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia came to another standstill. &ldquo;Slander?&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;and said
      no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid&rsquo;s anger broke out. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Or a lie, if you like, told of
      a woman as high above reproach as your mother or mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hot,&rdquo; the doctor remarked, and walked on again. &ldquo;When I was in
      Italy&mdash;&rdquo; he paused to calculate, &ldquo;when I was at Rome, fifteen years
      ago, your cousin was a wretched little rickety child. I said to Robert
      Graywell, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get too fond of that girl; she&rsquo;ll never live to grow up.&rsquo; 
      He said something about taking her away to the mountain air. I didn&rsquo;t
      think, myself, the mountain air would be of any use. It seems I was wrong.
      Well! it&rsquo;s a surprise to me to find her&mdash;&rdquo; he waited, and calculated
      again, &ldquo;to find her grown up to be seventeen years old.&rdquo; To Ovid&rsquo;s ears,
      there was an inhuman indifference in his tone as he said this, which it
      was impossible not to resent, by looks, if not in words. Benjulia noticed
      the impression that he had produced, without in the least understanding
      it. &ldquo;Your nervous system&rsquo;s in a nasty state,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;you had better
      take care of yourself. I&rsquo;ll go and look at the monkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was like the face of the impenetrable sphinx; his deep bass voice
      droned placidly. Ovid&rsquo;s anger had passed by him like the passing of the
      summer air. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and take care of those nasty nerves. I
      tell you again&mdash;they mean mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not altogether willingly, Ovid made his apologies. &ldquo;If I have
      misunderstood you, I beg your pardon. At the same time, I don&rsquo;t think I am
      to blame. Why did you mislead me by using that detestable word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it the right word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right word&mdash;when you only wanted to speak of a poor sickly
      child! Considering that you took your degree at Oxford&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could expect nothing better from the disadvantages of my education,&rdquo;
       said the doctor, finishing the sentence with the grave composure that
      distinguished him. &ldquo;When I said &lsquo;misbegotten,&rsquo; perhaps I ought to have
      said &lsquo;half-begotten&rsquo;? Thank you for reminding me. I&rsquo;ll look at the
      dictionary when I get home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid&rsquo;s mind was not set at ease yet. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one other thing,&rdquo; he
      persisted, &ldquo;that seems unaccountable.&rdquo; He started, and seized Benjulia by
      the arm. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried, with a sudden outburst of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the doctor, stopping directly. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Ovid, recoiling from a stain on the gravel walk, caused by
      the remains of an unlucky beetle, crushed under his friend&rsquo;s heavy foot.
      &ldquo;You trod on the beetle before I could stop you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia&rsquo;s astonishment at finding an adult male human being (not in a
      lunatic asylum) anxious to spare the life of a beetle, literally struck
      him speechless. His medical instincts came to his assistance. &ldquo;You had
      better leave London at once,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Get into pure air, and be out
      of doors all day long.&rdquo; He turned over the remains of the beetle with the
      end of his stick. &ldquo;The common beetle,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t damaged a
      Specimen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid returned to the subject, which had suffered interruption through his
      abortive little act of mercy. &ldquo;You knew my uncle in Italy. It seems
      strange, Benjulia, that I should never have heard of it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I knew your uncle; and,&rdquo; he added with especial emphasis, &ldquo;I knew
      his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say I felt any particular interest in either of them.
      Nothing happened afterwards to put me in mind of the acquaintance till you
      told me who the young lady was, just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely my mother must have reminded you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I can remember. Women in her position don&rsquo;t much fancy talking
      of a relative who has married&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped to choose his next words.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be rude; suppose we say married beneath him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reflection told Ovid that this was true. Even in conversation with himself
      (before the arrival in England of Robert&rsquo;s Will), his mother rarely
      mentioned her brother&mdash;and still more rarely his family. There was
      another reason for Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s silence, known only to herself. Robert
      was in the secret of her debts, and Robert had laid her under heavy
      pecuniary obligations. The very sound of his name was revolting to his
      amiable sister: it reminded her of that humiliating sense, known in
      society as a sense of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina was still waiting&mdash;and there was nothing further to be gained
      by returning to the subject of her mother with such a man as Benjulia.
      Ovid held out his hand to say good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the offered hand readily enough, the doctor repeated his odd
      question&mdash;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been rude, have I?&rdquo;&mdash;with an unpleasant
      appearance of going through a form purely for form&rsquo;s sake. Ovid&rsquo;s natural
      generosity of feeling urged him to meet the advance, strangely as it had
      been made, with a friendly reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is I who have been rude,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you go back with
      me, and be introduced to Carmina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia made his acknowledgments in his own remarkable way. &ldquo;No, thank
      you,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather see the monkey.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Zo had become the innocent cause of a difference of
      opinion between two no less dissimilar personages than Maria and the
      duenna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having her mind full of the sick monkey, the child felt a natural
      curiosity to see the other monkeys who were well. Amiable Miss Minerva
      consulted her young friend from Italy before she complied with Zo&rsquo;s
      wishes. Would Miss Carmina like to visit the monkey-house? Ovid&rsquo;s cousin,
      remembering Ovid&rsquo;s promise, looked towards the end of the walk. He was not
      returning to her&mdash;he was not even in sight. Carmina resigned herself
      to circumstances, with a little air of pique which was duly registered in
      Miss Minerva&rsquo;s memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the monkey-house, Teresa appeared in a new character. She
      surprised her companions by showing an interest in natural history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they all monkeys in that big place?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much
      about foreign beasts. How do they like it, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This comprehensive inquiry was addressed to the governess, as the most
      learned person present. Miss Minerva referred to her elder pupil with an
      encouraging smile. &ldquo;Maria will inform you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Her studies in
      natural history have made her well acquainted with the habits of monkeys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus authorised to exhibit her learning, even the discreet Maria actually
      blushed with pleasure. It was that young lady&rsquo;s most highly-prized reward
      to display her knowledge (in imitation of her governess&rsquo;s method of
      instruction) for the benefit of unfortunate persons of the lower rank,
      whose education had been imperfectly carried out. The tone of amiable
      patronage with which she now imparted useful information to a woman old
      enough to be her grandmother, would have made the hands of the bygone
      generation burn to box her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The monkeys are kept in large and airy cages,&rdquo; Maria began; &ldquo;and the
      temperature is regulated with the utmost care. I shall be happy to point
      out to you the difference between the monkey and the ape. You are not
      perhaps aware that the members of the latter family are called &lsquo;Simiadae,&rsquo; 
      and are without tails and cheek-pouches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Listening so far in dumb amazement, Teresa checked the flow of information
      at tails and cheek-pouches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What gibberish is this child talking to me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I want to know
      how the monkeys amuse themselves in that large house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria&rsquo;s perfect training condescended to enlighten even this state of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have ropes to swing on,&rdquo; she answered sweetly; &ldquo;and visitors feed
      them through the wires of the cage. Branches of trees are also placed for
      their diversion; reminding many of them no doubt of the vast tropical
      forests in which, as we learn from travellers, they pass in flocks from
      tree to tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa held up her hand as a signal to stop. &ldquo;A little of You, my young
      lady, goes a long way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Consider how much I can hold, before
      you cram me at this rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria was bewildered, but nor daunted yet. &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;I
      fear I don&rsquo;t quite understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there are two of us puzzled,&rdquo; the duenna remarked. <i>&ldquo;I</i> don&rsquo;t
      understand <i>you.</i> I shan&rsquo;t go into that house. A Christian can&rsquo;t be
      expected to care about beasts&mdash;but right is right all the world over.
      Because a monkey is a nasty creature (as I have heard, not even good to
      eat when he&rsquo;s dead), that&rsquo;s no reason for taking him out of his own
      country and putting him into a cage. If we are to see creatures in prison,
      let&rsquo;s see creatures who have deserved it&mdash;men and women, rogues and
      sluts. The monkeys haven&rsquo;t deserved it. Go in&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait for you at
      the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Setting her bitterest emphasis on this protest, which expressed inveterate
      hostility to Maria (using compassion for caged animals as the readiest
      means at hand), Teresa seated herself in triumph on the nearest bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young person, possessed of no more than ordinary knowledge, might have
      left the old woman to enjoy the privilege of saying the last word. Miss
      Minerva&rsquo;s pupil, exuding information as it were at every pore in her skin,
      had been rudely dried up at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Even earthly perfection has
      its weak places within reach. Maria lost her temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will allow me to remind you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that intelligent curiosity
      leads us to study the habits of animals that are new to us. We place them
      in a cage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa lost <i>her</i> temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an animal that&rsquo;s new to me,&rdquo; cried the irate duenna. &ldquo;I never in
      all my life met with such a child before. If you please, madam governess,
      put this girl into a cage. My intelligent curiosity wants to study a
      monkey that&rsquo;s new to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for Teresa that she was Carmina&rsquo;s favourite and friend,
      and, as such, a person to be carefully handled. Miss Minerva stopped the
      growing quarrel with the readiest discretion and good-feeling. She patted
      Teresa on the shoulder, and looked at Carmina with a pleasant smile.
      &ldquo;Worthy old creature! how full of humour she is! The energy of the people,
      Miss Carmina. I often remark the quaint force with which they express
      their ideas. No&mdash;not a word of apology, I beg and pray. Maria, my
      dear, take your sister&rsquo;s hand, and we will follow.&rdquo; She put her arm in
      Carmina&rsquo;s arm with the happiest mixture of familiarity and respect, and
      she nodded to Carmina&rsquo;s old companion with the cordiality of a
      good-humoured friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa was not further irritated by being kept waiting for any length of
      time. In a few minutes Carmina joined her on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired of the beasts already, my pretty one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than tired&mdash;driven away by the smell! Dear old Teresa, why did
      you speak so roughly to Miss Minerva and Maria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I hate them! because I hate the family! Was your poor father
      demented in his last moments, when he trusted you among these detestable
      people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina listened in astonishment. &ldquo;You said just the contrary of the
      family,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;only yesterday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa hung her head in confusion. Her well-meant attempt to reconcile
      Carmina to the new life on which she had entered was now revealed as a
      sham, thanks to her own outbreak of temper. The one honest alternative
      left was to own the truth, and put Carmina on her guard without alarming
      her, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never tell a lie again, as long as I live,&rdquo; Teresa declared. &ldquo;You
      see I didn&rsquo;t like to discourage you. After all, I dare say I&rsquo;m more wrong
      than right in my opinion. But it <i>is</i> my opinion, for all that. I
      hate those women, mistress and governess, both alike. There! now it&rsquo;s out.
      Are you angry with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am never angry with you, my old friend; I am only a little vexed. Don&rsquo;t
      say you hate people, after only knowing them for a day or two! I am sure
      Miss Minerva has been very kind&mdash;to me, as well as to you. I feel
      ashamed of myself already for having begun by disliking her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa took her young mistress&rsquo;s hand, and patted it compassionately.
      &ldquo;Poor innocent, if you only had my experience to help you! There are good
      ones and bad ones among all creatures. I say to you the Gallilees are bad
      ones! Even their music-master (I saw him this morning) looks like a rogue.
      You will tell me the poor old gentleman is harmless, surely. I shall not
      contradict that&mdash;I shall only ask, what is the use of a man who is as
      weak as water? Oh, I like him, but I distinguish! I also like Zo. But what
      is a child&mdash;especially when that beastly governess has muddled her
      unfortunate little head with learning? No, my angel, there&rsquo;s but one
      person among these people who comforts me, when I think of the day that
      will part us. Ha! do I see a little colour coming into your cheeks? You
      sly girl! you know who it is. <i>There</i> is what I call a Man! If I was
      as young as you are, and as pretty as you are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A warning gesture from Carmina closed Teresa&rsquo;s lips. Ovid was rapidly
      approaching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked a little annoyed, and he made his apologies without mentioning
      the doctor&rsquo;s name. His cousin was interested enough in him already to ask
      herself what this meant. Did he really dislike Benjulia, and had there
      been some disagreement between them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the tall doctor so very interesting?&rdquo; she ventured to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least!&rdquo; He answered as if the subject was disagreeable to him&mdash;and
      yet he returned to it. &ldquo;By-the-by, did you ever hear Benjulia&rsquo;s name
      mentioned, at home in Italy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! Did he know my father and mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do introduce me to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must wait a little. He prefers being introduced to the monkey to-day.
      Where are Miss Minerva and the children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa replied. She pointed to the monkey-house, and then drew Ovid aside.
      &ldquo;Take her to see some more birds, and trust me to keep the governess out
      of your way,&rdquo; whispered the good creature. &ldquo;Make love&mdash;hot love to
      her, doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a minute more the cousins were out of sight. How are you to make love
      to a young girl, after an acquaintance of a day or two? The question would
      have been easily answered by some men. It thoroughly puzzled Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad to get back to you!&rdquo; he said, honestly opening his mind to
      her. &ldquo;Were you half as glad when you saw me return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew nothing of the devious and serpentine paths by which love finds
      the way to its ends. It had not occurred to him to approach her with those
      secret tones and stolen looks which speak for themselves. She answered
      with the straightforward directness of which he had set the example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think me insensible to your kindness,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am
      more pleased and more proud than I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud!&rdquo; Ovid repeated, not immediately understanding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;My poor father used to say you would be an honour
      to the family. Ought I not to be proud, when I find such a man taking so
      much notice of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him shyly. At that moment, he would have resigned all his
      prospects of celebrity for the privilege of kissing her. He made another
      attempt to bring her&mdash;in spirit&mdash;a little nearer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carmina, do you remember where you first saw me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you ask?&mdash;it was in the concert-room. When I saw you there,
      I remembered passing you in the large Square. It seems a strange
      coincidence that you should have gone to the very concert that Teresa and
      I went to by accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid ran the risk, and made his confession. &ldquo;It was no coincidence,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;After our meeting in the Square I followed you to the concert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This bold avowal would have confused a less innocent girl. It only took
      Carmina by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you follow us?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Us? Did she suppose he had followed the old woman? Ovid lost no time in
      setting her right. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even see Teresa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I followed You.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. What did her silence mean? Was she confused, or was she
      still at a loss to understand him? That morbid sensitiveness, which was
      one of the most serious signs of his failing health, was by this time
      sufficiently irritated to hurry him into extremities. &ldquo;Did you ever hear,&rdquo;
       he asked, &ldquo;of such a thing as love at first sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started. Surprise, confusion, doubt, succeeded each other in rapid
      changes on her mobile and delicate face. Still silent, she roused her
      courage, and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had returned the look, he would have told the story of his first
      love without another word to help him. But his shattered nerves unmanned
      him, at the moment of all others when it was his interest to be bold. The
      fear that he might have allowed himself to speak too freely&mdash;a
      weakness which would never have misled him in his days of health and
      strength&mdash;kept his eyes on the ground. She looked away again with a
      quick flush of shame. When such a man as Ovid spoke of love at first
      sight, what an instance of her own vanity it was to have thought that his
      mind was dwelling on <i>her!</i> He had kindly lowered himself to the
      level of a girl&rsquo;s intelligence, and had been trying to interest her by
      talking the language of romance. She was so dissatisfied with herself that
      she made a movement to turn back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too bitterly disappointed, on his side, to attempt to prolong the
      interview. A deadly sense of weakness was beginning to overpower him. It
      was the inevitable result of his utter want of care for himself. After a
      sleepless night, he had taken a long walk before breakfast; and to these
      demands on his failing reserves of strength, he had now added the fatigue
      of dawdling about a garden. Physically and mentally he had no energy left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; he said to Carmina sadly; &ldquo;I am afraid I have offended
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how little you know me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if you think that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time their eyes met. The truth dawned on her&mdash;and he saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand. The clammy coldness of his grasp startled her. &ldquo;Do you
      still wonder why I followed you?&rdquo; he asked. The words were so faintly
      uttered that she could barely hear them. Heavy drops of perspiration stood
      on his forehead; his face faded to a gray and ghastly whiteness&mdash;he
      staggered, and tried desperately to catch at the branch of a tree near
      them. She threw her arms round him. With all her little strength she tried
      to hold him up. Her utmost effort only availed to drag him to the grass
      plot by their side, and to soften his fall. Even as the cry for help
      passed her lips, she saw help coming. A tall man was approaching her&mdash;not
      running, even when he saw what had happened; only stalking with long
      strides. He was followed by one of the keepers of the gardens. Doctor
      Benjulia had his sick monkey to take care of. He kept the creature
      sheltered under his long frock-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, if you please,&rdquo; was all the doctor said, as Carmina tried
      to lift Ovid&rsquo;s head from the grass. He spoke with his customary composure,
      and laid his hand on the heart of the fainting man, as coolly as if it had
      been the heart of a stranger. &ldquo;Which of you two can run the fastest?&rdquo; he
      asked, looking backwards and forwards between Carmina and the keeper. &ldquo;I
      want some brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The refreshment room was within sight. Before the keeper quite understood
      what was required of him, Carmina was speeding over the grass like
      Atalanta herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia looked after her, with his usual grave attention. &ldquo;That wench can
      run,&rdquo; he said to himself, and turned once more to Ovid. &ldquo;In his state of
      health, he&rsquo;s been fool enough to over-exert himself.&rdquo; So he disposed of
      the case in his own mind. Having done that, he remembered the monkey,
      deposited for the time being on the grass. &ldquo;Too cold for him,&rdquo; he
      remarked, with more appearance of interest than he had shown yet. &ldquo;Here,
      keeper! Pick up the monkey till I&rsquo;m ready to take him again.&rdquo; The man
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might bite me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick him up!&rdquo; the doctor reiterated; &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t bite anybody, after what
      I&rsquo;ve done to him.&rdquo; The monkey was indeed in a state of stupor. The keeper
      obeyed his instructions, looking half stupefied himself: he seemed to be
      even more afraid of the doctor than of the monkey. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m the
      Devil?&rdquo; Benjulia asked with dismal irony. The man looked as if he would
      say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; if he dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina came running back with the brandy. The doctor smelt it first, and
      then took notice of her. &ldquo;Out of breath?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give him the brandy?&rdquo; she answered impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong lungs,&rdquo; Benjulia proceeded, sitting down cross-legged by Ovid, and
      administering the stimulant without hurrying himself. &ldquo;Some girls would
      not have been able to speak, after such a run as you have had. I didn&rsquo;t
      think much of you or your lungs when you were a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he coming to himself?&rdquo; Carmina asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what a pump is?&rdquo; Benjulia rejoined. &ldquo;Very well; a pump
      sometimes gets out of order. Give the carpenter time, and he&rsquo;ll put it
      right again.&rdquo; He let his mighty hand drop on Ovid&rsquo;s breast. <i>&ldquo;This</i>
      pump is out of order; and I&rsquo;m the carpenter. Give me time, and I&rsquo;ll set it
      right again. You&rsquo;re not a bit like your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Watching eagerly for the slightest signs of recovery in Ovid&rsquo;s face,
      Carmina detected a faint return of colour. She was so relieved that she
      was able to listen to the doctor&rsquo;s oddly discursive talk, and even to join
      in it. &ldquo;Some of our friends used to think I was like my father,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they?&rdquo; said Benjulia&mdash;and shut his thin-lipped mouth as if he
      was determined to drop the subject for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid stirred feebly, and half opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia got up. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me any longer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, Mr.
      Keeper, give me back the monkey.&rdquo; He dismissed the man, and tucked the
      monkey under one arm as if it had been a bundle. &ldquo;There are your friends,&rdquo;
       he resumed, pointing to the end of the walk. &ldquo;Good-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina stopped him. Too anxious to stand on ceremony, she laid her hand
      on his arm. He shook it off&mdash;not angrily: just brushing it away, as
      he might have brushed away the ash of his cigar or a splash of mud in the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this fainting fit mean?&rdquo; she asked timidly. &ldquo;Is Ovid going to
      be ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously ill&mdash;unless you do the right thing with him, and do it at
      once.&rdquo; He walked away. She followed him, humbly and yet resolutely. &ldquo;Tell
      me, if you please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what we are to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked back over his shoulder. &ldquo;Send him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned, and knelt down by Ovid&mdash;still slowly reviving. With a
      fond and gentle hand, she wiped the moisture from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as we were beginning to understand each other!&rdquo; she said to herself,
      with a sad little sigh.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days passed. In spite of the warnings that he had received, Ovid
      remained in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indisputable authority of Benjulia had no more effect on him than the
      unanswerable arguments of Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;Recent circumstances&rdquo; (as his
      mother expressed it) &ldquo;had strengthened his infatuated resistance to
      reason.&rdquo; The dreaded necessity for Teresa&rsquo;s departure had been hastened by
      a telegram from Italy: Ovid felt for Carmina&rsquo;s distress with sympathies
      which made her dearer to him than ever. On the second morning after the
      visit to the Zoological Gardens, her fortitude had been severely tried.
      She had found the telegram under her pillow, enclosed in a farewell
      letter. Teresa had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Carmina,&mdash;I have kissed you, and cried over you, and I am writing
      good-bye as well as my poor eyes will let me. Oh, my heart&rsquo;s darling, I
      cannot be cruel enough to wake you, and see you suffer! Forgive me for
      going away, with only this dumb farewell. I am so fond of you&mdash;that
      is my only excuse. While he still lives, my helpless old man has his claim
      on me. Write by every post, and trust me to write back&mdash;and remember
      what I said when I spoke of Ovid. Love the good man who loves <i>you;</i>
      and try to make the best of the others. They cannot surely be cruel to the
      poor angel who depends on their kindness. Oh, how hard life is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paper was blotted, and the rest was illegible.

    <p>
      The miserable day of Teresa&rsquo;s departure was passed by Carmina in the
      solitude of her room: gently and firmly, she refused to see anyone. This
      strange conduct added to Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s anxieties. Already absorbed in
      considering Ovid&rsquo;s obstinacy, and the means of overcoming it, she was now
      confronted by a resolute side in the character of her niece, which took
      her by surprise. There might be difficulties to come, in managing Carmina,
      which she had not foreseen. Meanwhile, she was left to act on her own
      unaided discretion in the serious matter of her son&rsquo;s failing health.
      Benjulia had refused to help her; he was too closely occupied in his
      laboratory to pay or receive visits. &ldquo;I have already given my advice&rdquo; (the
      doctor wrote). &ldquo;Send him away. When he has had a month&rsquo;s change, let me
      see his letters; and then, if I have anything more to say, I will tell you
      what I think of your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left in this position, Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s hard self-denial yielded to the one
      sound conclusion that lay before her. The only influence that could be now
      used over Ovid, with the smallest chance of success, was the influence of
      Carmina. Three days after Teresa&rsquo;s departure, she invited her niece to
      take tea in her own boudoir. Carmina found her reading. &ldquo;A charming book,&rdquo;
       she said, as she laid it down, &ldquo;on a most interesting subject,
      Geographical Botany. The author divides the earth into twenty-five
      botanical regions&mdash;but, I forget; you are not like Maria; you don&rsquo;t
      care about these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so ignorant,&rdquo; Carmina pleaded. &ldquo;Perhaps, I may know better when I
      get older.&rdquo; A book on the table attracted her by its beautiful binding.
      She took it up. Mrs. Gallilee looked at her with compassionate good
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Science again, my dear,&rdquo; she said facetiously, &ldquo;inviting you in a pretty
      dress! You have taken up the &lsquo;Curiosities of Coprolites.&rsquo; That book is one
      of my distinctions&mdash;a presentation copy from the author.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are Coprolites?&rdquo; Carmina asked, trying to inform herself on the
      subject of her aunt&rsquo;s distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still good-humoured, but with an effort that began to appear, Mrs.
      Gallilee lowered herself to the level of her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coprolites,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;are the fossilised indigestions of extinct
      reptiles. The great philosopher who has written that book has discovered
      scales, bones, teeth, and shells&mdash;the undigested food of those
      interesting Saurians. What a man! what a field for investigation! Tell me
      about your own reading. What have you found in the library?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very interesting books&mdash;at least to me,&rdquo; Carmina answered. &ldquo;I have
      found many volumes of poetry. Do you ever read poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee laid herself back in her chair, and submitted patiently to
      her niece&rsquo;s simplicity. &ldquo;Poetry?&rdquo; she repeated, in accents of resignation.
      &ldquo;Oh, good heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unlucky Carmina tried a more promising topic. &ldquo;What beautiful flowers you
      have in the drawing-room!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing remarkable, my dear. Everybody has flowers in their drawing-rooms&mdash;they
      are part of the furniture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you arrange them yourself, aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee still endured it. &ldquo;The florist&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;does all
      that. I sometimes dissect flowers, but I never trouble myself to arrange
      them. What would be the use of the man if I did?&rdquo; This view of the
      question struck Carmina dumb. Mrs. Gallilee went on. &ldquo;By-the-by, talking
      of flowers reminds one of other superfluities. Have you tried the piano in
      your room? Will it do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tone is quite perfect!&rdquo; Carmina answered with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Did you
      choose it?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee looked as if she was going to say &ldquo;Good
      Heavens!&rdquo; again, and perhaps to endure it no longer. Carmina was too
      simple to interpret these signs in the right way. Why should her aunt not
      choose a piano? &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like music?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee made a last effort. &ldquo;When you see a little more of society,
      my child, you will know that one <i>must</i> like music. So again with
      pictures&mdash;one <i>must</i> go to the Royal Academy Exhibition. So
      again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could mention any more social sacrifices, the servant came in
      with a letter, and stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee looked at the address. The weary indifference of her manner
      changed to vivid interest, the moment she saw the handwriting. &ldquo;From the
      Professor!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Excuse me, for one minute.&rdquo; She read the
      letter, and closed it again with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; she said
      to herself. &ldquo;I have always maintained that the albuminoid substance of
      frog&rsquo;s eggs is insufficient (viewed as nourishment) to transform a tadpole
      into a frog&mdash;and, at last, the Professor owns that I am right. I beg
      your pardon, Carmina; I am carried away by a subject that I have been
      working at in my stolen intervals for weeks past. Let me give you some
      tea. I have asked Miss Minerva to join us. What is keeping her, I wonder?
      She is usually so punctual. I suppose Zoe has been behaving badly again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more, the governess herself confirmed this maternal
      forewarning of the truth. Zo had declined to commit to memory &ldquo;the
      political consequences of the granting of Magna Charta&rdquo;&mdash;and now
      stood reserved for punishment, when her mother &ldquo;had time to attend to it.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Gallilee at once disposed of this little responsibility. &ldquo;Bread and
      water for tea,&rdquo; she said, and proceeded to the business of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to speak to you both,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;on the subject of my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two persons addressed waited in silence to hear more. Carmina&rsquo;s head
      drooped: she looked down. Miss Minerva attentively observed Mrs. Gallilee.
      &ldquo;Why am I invited to hear what she has to say about her son?&rdquo; was the
      question which occurred to the governess. &ldquo;Is she afraid that Carmina
      might tell me about it, if I was not let into the family secrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Admirably reasoned, and correctly guessed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee had latterly observed that the governess was insinuating
      herself into the confidence of her niece&mdash;that is to say, into the
      confidence of a young lady, whose father was generally reported to have
      died in possession of a handsome fortune. Personal influence, once
      obtained over an heiress, is not infrequently misused. To check the
      further growth of a friendship of this sort (without openly offending Miss
      Minerva) was an imperative duty. Mrs. Gallilee saw her way to the discreet
      accomplishment of that object. Her niece and her governess were interested&mdash;diversely
      interested&mdash;in Ovid. If she invited them both together, to consult
      with her on the delicate subject of her son, there would be every chance
      of exciting some difference of opinion, sufficiently irritating to begin
      the process of estrangement, by keeping them apart when they had left the
      tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most important that there should be no misunderstanding among us,&rdquo;
       Mrs. Gallilee proceeded. &ldquo;Let me set the example of speaking without
      reserve. We all three know that Ovid persists in remaining in London&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, on the point of finishing the sentence. Although she <i>had</i>
      converted a Professor, Mrs. Gallilee was still only a woman. There did
      enter into her other calculations, the possibility of exciting some
      accidental betrayal of her governess&rsquo;s passion for her son. On alluding to
      Ovid, she turned suddenly to Miss Minerva. &ldquo;I am sure you will excuse my
      troubling you with family anxieties,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;especially when they
      are connected with the health of my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was cleverly done, but it laboured under one disadvantage. Miss Minerva
      had no idea of what the needless apology meant, having no suspicion of the
      discovery of her secret by her employer. But to feel herself baffled in
      trying to penetrate Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s motives was enough, of itself, to put
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s governess on her guard for the rest of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You honour me, madam, by admitting me to your confidence&rdquo;&mdash;was what
      she said. &ldquo;Trip me up, you cat, if you can!&rdquo;&mdash;was what she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know that Ovid persists in remaining in London, when change of air and
      scene are absolutely necessary to the recovery of his health. And we know
      why. Carmina, my child, don&rsquo;t think for a moment that I blame you! don&rsquo;t
      even suppose that I blame my son. You are too charming a person not to
      excuse, nay even to justify, any man&rsquo;s admiration. But let us (as we hard
      old people say) look the facts in the face. If Ovid had not seen you, he
      would be now on the health-giving sea, on his way to Spain and Italy. You
      are the innocent cause of his obstinate indifference, his most deplorable
      and dangerous disregard of the duty which he owes to himself. He refuses
      to listen to his mother, he sets the opinion of his skilled medical
      colleague at defiance. But one person has any influence over him now.&rdquo; She
      paused again, and tried to trip up the governess once more. &ldquo;Miss Minerva,
      let me appeal to You. I regard you as a member of our family; I have the
      sincerest admiration of your tact and good sense. Am I exceeding the
      limits of delicacy, if I say plainly to my niece, Persuade Ovid to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Carmina had possessed an elder sister, with a plain personal appearance
      and an easy conscience, not even that sister could have matched the
      perfect composure with which Miss Minerva replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t possess your happy faculty of expressing yourself, Mrs. Gallilee.
      But, if I had been in your place, I should have said to the best of my
      poor ability exactly what you have said now.&rdquo; She bent her head with a
      graceful gesture of respect, and looked at Carmina with a gentle sisterly
      interest while she stirred her tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very opening of the skirmish, Mrs. Gallilee was defeated. She had
      failed to provoke the slightest sign of jealousy, or even of ill-temper.
      Unquestionably the most crafty and most cruel woman of the two&mdash;possessing
      the most dangerously deceitful manner, and the most mischievous readiness
      of language&mdash;she was, nevertheless, Miss Minerva&rsquo;s inferior in the
      one supreme capacity of which they both stood in need, the capacity for
      self-restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed this inferiority on expressing her thanks. The underlying
      malice broke through the smooth surface that was intended to hide it. &ldquo;I
      am apt to doubt myself,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and such sound encouragement as yours
      always relieves me. Of course I don&rsquo;t ask you for more than a word of
      advice. Of course I don&rsquo;t expect <i>you</i> to persuade Ovid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Miss Minerva agreed. &ldquo;May I ask for a little more sugar
      in my tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee turned to Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear? I have spoken to you, as I might have spoken to one of my
      own daughters, if she had been of your age. Tell me frankly, in return,
      whether I may count on your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still pale and downcast, Carmina obeyed. &ldquo;I will do my best, if you wish
      it. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still hesitated. Mrs. Gallilee tried gentle remonstrance. &ldquo;My child,
      surely you are not afraid of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was certainly afraid. But she controlled herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Ovid&rsquo;s mother, and I am only his cousin,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      like to hear you say that my influence over him is greater than yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was far from the poor girl&rsquo;s intention; but there was an implied rebuke
      in this. In her present state of irritation, Mrs. Gallilee felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t affect to be ignorant, my dear, of what you
      know perfectly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina lifted her head. For the first time in the experience of the two
      elder women, this gentle creature showed that she could resent an insult.
      The fine spirit that was in her fired her eyes, and fixed them firmly on
      her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you accuse me of deceit?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us call it false modesty,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina rose without another word&mdash;and walked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the extremity of her surprise, Mrs. Gallilee appealed to Miss Minerva.
      &ldquo;Is she in a passion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t bang the door,&rdquo; the governess quietly remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not joking, Miss Minerva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not joking either, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of that answer implied an uncompromising assertion of equality.
      You are not to suppose (it said) that a lady drops below your level,
      because she receives a salary and teaches your children. Mrs. Gallilee was
      so angry, by this time, that she forgot the importance of preventing a
      conference between Miss Minerva and her niece. For once, she was the
      creature of impulse&mdash;the overpowering impulse to dismiss her insolent
      governess from her hospitable table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I offer you another cup of tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;no more. May I return to my pupils?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina had not been five minutes in her own room before she heard a knock
      at the door. Had Mrs. Gallilee followed her? &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; she asked.
      And a voice outside answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Miss Minerva!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have startled you?&rdquo; said the governess, carefully closing
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was my aunt,&rdquo; Carmina answered, as simply as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been crying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, Miss Minerva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee spoke cruelly to you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wonder at your feeling
      angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina gently shook her head. &ldquo;I have been crying,&rdquo; she explained,
      &ldquo;because I am sorry and ashamed. How can I make it up with my aunt? Shall
      I go back at once and beg her pardon? I think you are my friend, Miss
      Minerva. Will you advise me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was so prettily and innocently said that even the governess was touched&mdash;for
      a moment. &ldquo;Shall I prove to you that I am your friend?&rdquo; she proposed. &ldquo;I
      advise you not to go back yet to your aunt&mdash;and I will tell you why.
      Mrs. Gallilee bears malice; she is a thoroughly unforgiving woman. And I
      should be the first to feel it, if she knew what I have just said to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Minerva! you don&rsquo;t think that I would betray your confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, I don&rsquo;t. I felt attracted towards you, when we first met.
      You didn&rsquo;t return the feeling&mdash;you (very naturally) disliked me. I am
      ugly and ill-tempered: and, if there is anything good in me, it doesn&rsquo;t
      show itself on the surface. Yes! yes! I believe you are beginning to
      understand me. If I can make your life here a little happier, as time goes
      on, I shall be only too glad to do it.&rdquo; She put her long yellow hands on
      either side of Carmina&rsquo;s head, and kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor child threw her arms round Miss Minerva&rsquo;s neck, and cried her
      heart out on the bosom of the woman who was deceiving her. &ldquo;I have nobody
      left, now Teresa has gone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, do try to be kind to me&mdash;I
      feel so friendless and so lonely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva neither moved nor spoke. She waited, and let the girl cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heavy black eyebrows gathered into a frown; her sallow face deepened
      in colour. She was in a state of rebellion against herself. Through all
      the hardening influences of the woman&rsquo;s life&mdash;through the
      fortifications against good which watchful evil builds in human hearts&mdash;that
      innocent outburst of trust and grief had broken its way; and had purified
      for a while the fetid inner darkness with divine light. She had entered
      the room, with her own base interests to serve. In her small sordid way
      she, like her employer, was persecuted by debts&mdash;miserable debts to
      sellers of expensive washes, which might render her ugly complexion more
      passable in Ovid&rsquo;s eyes; to makers of costly gloves, which might show Ovid
      the shape of her hands, and hide their colour; to skilled workmen in fine
      leather, who could tempt Ovid to look at her high instep, and her fine
      ankle&mdash;the only beauties that she could reveal to the only man whom
      she cared to please. For the time, those importunate creditors ceased to
      threaten her. For the time, what she had heard in the conservatory, while
      they were reading the Will, lost its tempting influence. She remained in
      the room for half an hour more&mdash;and she left it without having
      borrowed a farthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you easier now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina dried her eyes, and looked shyly at Miss Minerva. &ldquo;I have been
      treating you as if I had a sister,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think me too
      familiar, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was your sister, God knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were hardly out of her mouth before she was startled by her own
      fervour. &ldquo;Shall I tell you what to do with Mrs. Gallilee?&rdquo; she said
      abruptly. &ldquo;Write her a little note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes! and you will take it for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s eyes brightened through her tears, the suggestion was such a
      relief! In a minute the note was written: &ldquo;My dear Aunt, I have behaved
      very badly, and I am very much ashamed of it. May I trust to your kind
      indulgence to forgive me? I will try to be worthier of your kindness for
      the future; and I sincerely beg your pardon.&rdquo; She signed her name in
      breathless haste. &ldquo;Please take it at once!&rdquo; she said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva smiled. &ldquo;If I take it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall do harm instead of
      good&mdash;I shall be accused of interfering. Give it to one of the
      servants. Not yet! When Mrs. Gallilee is angry, she doesn&rsquo;t get over it so
      soon as you seem to think. Leave her to dabble in science first,&rdquo; said the
      governess in tones of immeasurable contempt. &ldquo;When she has half stifled
      herself with some filthy smell, or dissected some wretched insect or
      flower, she may be in a better humour. Wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina thought of the happy days at home in Italy, when her father used
      to laugh at her little outbreaks of temper, and good Teresa only shrugged
      her shoulders. What a change&mdash;oh, me, what a change for the worse!
      She drew from her bosom a locket, hung round her neck by a thin gold chain&mdash;and
      opened it, and kissed the glass over the miniature portraits inside.
      &ldquo;Would you like to see them?&rdquo; she said to Miss Minerva. &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s
      likeness was painted for me by my father; and then he had his photograph
      taken to match it. I open my portraits and look at them, while I say my
      prayers. It&rsquo;s almost like having them alive again, sometimes. Oh, if I
      only had my father to advise me now&mdash;!&rdquo; Her heart swelled&mdash;but
      she kept back the tears: she was learning that self-restraint, poor soul,
      already! &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I ought not to want advice. After that
      fainting-fit in the Gardens, if I can persuade Ovid to leave us, I ought
      to do it&mdash;and I will do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva crossed the room, and looked out of window. Carmina had
      roused the dormant jealousy; Carmina had fatally weakened the good
      influences which she had herself produced. The sudden silence of her new
      friend perplexed her. She too went to the window. &ldquo;Do you think it would
      be taking a liberty?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short answer&mdash;and still looking out of window! Carmina tried again.
      &ldquo;Besides, there are my aunt&rsquo;s wishes to consider. After my bad behaviour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva turned round from the window sharply. &ldquo;Of course! There can&rsquo;t
      be a doubt of it.&rdquo; Her tone softened a little. &ldquo;You are young, Carmina&mdash;I
      suppose I may call you by your name&mdash;you are young and simple. Do
      those innocent eyes of yours ever see below the surface?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think your aunt&rsquo;s only motive in wishing Mr. Ovid Vere to leave
      London is anxiety about his health? Do you feel no suspicion that she
      wants to keep him away from You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina toyed with her locket, in an embarrassment which she was quite
      unable to disguise. &ldquo;Are you afraid to trust me?&rdquo; Miss Minerva asked. That
      reproach opened the girl&rsquo;s lips instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid to tell you how foolish I am,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Perhaps, I
      still feel a little strangeness between us? It seems to be so formal to
      call you Miss Minerva. I don&rsquo;t know what your Christian name is. Will you
      tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva replied rather unwillingly. &ldquo;My name is Frances. Don&rsquo;t call
      me Fanny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s too absurd to be endured! What does the mere sound of Fanny
      suggest? A flirting, dancing creature&mdash;plump and fair, and playful
      and pretty!&rdquo; She went to the looking-glass, and pointed disdainfully to
      the reflection of herself. &ldquo;Sickening to think of,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when you
      look at that. Call me Frances&mdash;a man&rsquo;s name, with only the difference
      between an i and an e. No sentiment in it; hard, like me. Well, what was
      it you didn&rsquo;t like to say of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina dropped her voice to a whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use asking me what I do
      see, or don&rsquo;t see, in my aunt,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am afraid we shall never
      be&mdash;what we ought to be to each other. When she came to that concert,
      and sat by me and looked at me&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, and shuddered over the
      recollection of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva urged her to go on&mdash;first, by a gesture; then by a
      suggestion: &ldquo;They said you fainted under the heat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel the heat. I felt a horrid creeping all over me. Before I
      looked at her, mind!&mdash;when I only knew that somebody was sitting next
      to me. And then, I did look round. Her eyes and my eyes flashed into each
      other. In that one moment, I lost all sense of myself as if I was dead. I
      can only tell you of it in that way. It was a dreadful surprise to me to
      remember it&mdash;and a dreadful pain&mdash;when they brought me to myself
      again. Though I do look so little and so weak, I am stronger than people
      think; I never fainted before. My aunt is&mdash;how can I say it properly?&mdash;hard
      to get on with since that time. Is there something wicked in my nature? I
      do believe she feels in the same way towards me. Yes; I dare say it&rsquo;s
      imagination, but it&rsquo;s as bad as reality for all that. Oh, I am sure you
      are right&mdash;she does want to keep Ovid out of my way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she doesn&rsquo;t like you?&rdquo; said Miss Minerva. &ldquo;Is that the only
      reason you can think of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other reason can there be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governess summoned her utmost power of self-restraint. She needed it,
      even to speak of the bare possibility of Carmina&rsquo;s marriage to Ovid, as if
      it was only a matter of speculative interest to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people object to marriages between cousins,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are
      cousins. Some people object to marriages between Catholics and
      Protestants. You are a Catholic&mdash;&rdquo; No! She could not trust herself to
      refer to him directly; she went on to the next sentence. &ldquo;And there might
      be some other reason,&rdquo; she resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what that is?&rdquo; Carmina asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you do&mdash;thus far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke the plain truth. Thanks to the dog&rsquo;s interruption, and to the
      necessity of saving herself from discovery, the last clauses of the Will
      had been read in her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you even guess what it is?&rdquo; Carmina persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee is very ambitious,&rdquo; the governess replied: &ldquo;and her son has
      a fortune of his own. She may wish him to marry a lady of high rank. But&mdash;no&mdash;she
      is always in need of money. In some way, money may be concerned in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; Carmina asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you,&rdquo; Miss Minerva answered, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the conversation could proceed, they were interrupted by the
      appearance of Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s maid, with a message from the schoolroom.
      Miss Maria wanted a little help in her Latin lesson. Noticing Carmina&rsquo;s
      letter, as she advanced to the door, it struck Miss Minerva that the woman
      might deliver it. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Gallilee at home?&rdquo; she asked. Mrs. Gallilee had
      just gone out. &ldquo;One of her scientific lectures, I suppose,&rdquo; said Miss
      Minerva to Carmina. &ldquo;Your note must wait till she comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed on the governess&mdash;and the lady&rsquo;s-maid took a liberty.
      She remained in the room; and produced a morsel of folded paper, hitherto
      concealed from view. Smirking and smiling, she handed the paper to
      Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Mr. Ovid, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Pray come to me; I am waiting for you in the garden of the Square.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      In those two lines, Ovid&rsquo;s note began and ended. Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s maid&mdash;deeply
      interested in an appointment which was not without precedent in her own
      experience&mdash;ventured on an expression of sympathy, before she
      returned to the servants&rsquo; hall. &ldquo;Please to excuse me, Miss; I hope Mr.
      Ovid isn&rsquo;t ill? He looked sadly pale, I thought. Allow me to give you your
      hat.&rdquo; Carmina thanked her, and hurried downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid was waiting at the gate of the Square&mdash;and he did indeed look
      wretchedly ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to make inquiries; they only seemed to irritate him. &ldquo;I am
      better already, now you have come to me.&rdquo; He said that, and led the way to
      a sheltered seat among the trees. In the later evening-time the Square was
      almost empty. Two middle-aged ladies, walking up and down (who
      considerately remembered their own youth, and kept out of the way), and a
      boy rigging a model yacht (who was too closely occupied to notice them),
      were the only persons in the enclosure besides themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does my mother know that you have come here?&rdquo; Ovid asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee has gone out. I didn&rsquo;t stop to think of it, when I got your
      letter. Am I doing wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid took her hand. &ldquo;Is it doing wrong to relieve me of anxieties that I
      have no courage to endure? When we meet in the house either my mother or
      her obedient servant, Miss Minerva, is sure to interrupt us. At last, my
      darling, I have got you to myself! You know that I love you. Why can&rsquo;t I
      look into your heart, and see what secrets it is keeping from me? I try to
      hope; but I want some little encouragement. Carmina! shall I ever hear you
      say that you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She trembled, and turned away her head. Her own words to the governess
      were in her mind; her own conviction of the want of all sympathy between
      his mother and herself made her shrink from answering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your silence.&rdquo; With those words he dropped her hand, and
      looked at her no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sadly, not bitterly spoken. She attempted to find excuses; she
      showed but too plainly how she pitied him. &ldquo;If I only had myself to think
      of&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice failed her. A new life came into his eyes, the colour
      rose in his haggard face: even those few faltering words had encouraged
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried again to make him understand her. &ldquo;I am so afraid of distressing
      you, Ovid; and I am so anxious not to make mischief between you and your
      mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has my mother to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on, without noticing the interruption. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t think me
      ungrateful? We had better speak of something else. Only this evening, your
      mother sent for me, and&mdash;don&rsquo;t be angry!&mdash;I am afraid she might
      be vexed if she knew what you have been saying to me. Perhaps I am wrong?
      Perhaps she only thinks I am too young. Oh, Ovid, how you look at me! Your
      mother hasn&rsquo;t said in so many words&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has she said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that question she saw the chance of speaking to him of other interests
      than the interests of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go away to another climate,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and your mother tells me
      I must persuade you to do it. I obey her with a heavy heart. Dear Ovid,
      you know how I shall miss you; you know what a loss it will be to me, when
      you say good-bye&mdash;but there is only one way to get well again. I
      entreat you to take that way! Your mother thinks I have some influence
      over you. Have I any influence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge for yourself,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You wish me to leave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your own sake. Only for your own sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to come back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cruel to ask the question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It rests with you, Carmina. Send me away when you like, and where you
      like. But, before I go, give me my one reason for making the sacrifice. No
      change will do anything for me, no climate will restore my health&mdash;unless
      you give me your love. I am old enough to know myself; I have thought of
      it by day and by night. Am I cruel to press you in this way? I will only
      say one word more. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what becomes of me&mdash;if you
      refuse to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without experience, without advice&mdash;with her own heart protesting
      against her silence&mdash;the restraint that she had laid on herself grew
      harder and harder to endure. The tears rose in her eyes. He saw them; they
      embittered his mind against his mother. With a darkening face he rose, and
      walked up and down before her, struggling with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my mother&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone terrified her. The dread, present to her mind all through the
      interview, of making herself a cause of estrangement between mother and
      son, so completely overcame her that she even made an attempt to defend
      Mrs. Gallilee! At the first words, he sat down by her again. For a moment,
      he scrutinised her face without mercy&mdash;and then repented of his own
      severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are afraid to tell me what has happened. I
      won&rsquo;t press you to speak against your own inclinations. It would be cruel
      and needless&mdash;I have got at the truth at last. In the one hope of my
      life, my mother is my enemy. She is bent on separating us; she shall not
      succeed. I won&rsquo;t leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina looked at him. His eyes dropped before her, in confusion and
      shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you angry with me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reproaches could have touched his heart as that question touched it.
      &ldquo;Angry with you? Oh, my darling, if you only knew how angry I am with
      myself! It cuts me to the heart to see how I have distressed you. I am a
      miserable selfish wretch; I don&rsquo;t deserve your love. Forgive me, and
      forget me. I will make the best atonement I can, Carmina. I will go away
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under hard trial, she had preserved her self-control. She had resisted
      him; she had resisted herself. His sudden submission disarmed her in an
      instant. With a low cry of love and fear she threw her arms round his
      neck, and laid her burning cheek against his face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she
      whispered; &ldquo;oh, Ovid, don&rsquo;t despise me!&rdquo; His arms closed round her; his
      lips were pressed to hers. &ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; he said. She kissed him, trembling
      in his embrace. That innocent self-abandonment did not plead with him in
      vain. He released her&mdash;and only held her hand. There was silence
      between them; long, happy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the first to speak again. &ldquo;How can I go away now?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She only smiled at that reckless forgetfulness of the promise, by which he
      had bound himself a few minutes since. &ldquo;What did you tell me,&rdquo; she asked
      playfully, &ldquo;when you called yourself by hard names, and said you didn&rsquo;t
      deserve my love?&rdquo; Her smile vanished softly, and left only a look of
      tender entreaty in its place. &ldquo;Set me an example of firmness, Ovid&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      leave it all to me! Remember what you have made me say. Remember&rdquo;&mdash;she
      only hesitated for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;remember what an interest I have in you
      now. I love you, Ovid. Say you will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it gratefully. &ldquo;My life is yours; my will is yours. Decide for me,
      and I will begin my journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so impressed by her sense of this new responsibility, that she
      answered him as gravely as if she had been his wife. &ldquo;I must give you time
      to pack up,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say time to be with You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell into thought. He asked if she was still considering when to send
      him away. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t that. I was wondering at myself. What
      is it that makes a great man like you so fond of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arm stole round her waist. He could just see her in the darkening
      twilight under the trees; the murmuring of the leaves was the only sound
      near them&mdash;his kisses lingered on her face. She sighed softly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      make it too hard for me to send you away!&rdquo; she whispered. He raised her,
      and put her arm in his. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will walk a little in the
      cool air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the subject of his departure. It was still early in the
      week. She inquired if Saturday would be too soon to begin his journey. No:
      he felt it, too&mdash;the longer they delayed, the harder the parting
      would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought yet where you will go?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must begin with a sea-voyage,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Long railway journeys, in
      my present state, will only do me harm. The difficulty is where to go to.
      I have been to America; India is too hot; Australia is too far. Benjulia
      has suggested Canada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he mentioned the doctor&rsquo;s name, her hand mechanically pressed his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That strange man!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even his name startles one; I hardly know
      what to think of him. He seemed to have more feeling for the monkey than
      for you or me. It was certainly kind of him to take the poor creature
      home, and try what he could do with it. Are you sure he is a great
      chemist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid stopped. Such a question, from Carmina, sounded strange to him. &ldquo;What
      makes you doubt it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t laugh at me, Ovid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you shall hear. We knew a famous Italian chemist at Rome&mdash;such a
      nice old man! He and my father used to play piquet; and I looked at them,
      and tried to learn&mdash;and I was too stupid. But I had plenty of
      opportunities of noticing our old friend&rsquo;s hands. They were covered with
      stains; and he caught me looking at them. He was not in the least
      offended; he told me his experiments had spotted his skin in that way, and
      nothing would clean off the stains. I saw Doctor Benjulia&rsquo;s great big
      hands, while he was giving you the brandy&mdash;and I remembered
      afterwards that there were no stains on them. I seem to surprise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do indeed surprise me. After knowing Benjulia for years, I have never
      noticed, what you have discovered on first seeing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has some way of cleaning the stains off his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid agreed to this, as the readiest means of dismissing the subject.
      Carmina had really startled him. Some irrational connection between the
      great chemist&rsquo;s attention to the monkey, and the perplexing purity of his
      hands, persisted in vaguely asserting itself in Ovid&rsquo;s mind. His
      unacknowledged doubts of Benjulia troubled him as they had never troubled
      him yet. He turned to Carmina for relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still thinking, my love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking of you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I want you to promise me something&mdash;and
      I am afraid to ask it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid? You don&rsquo;t love me, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will say it at once! How long do you expect to be away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two or three months, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise to wait till you return, before you tell your mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we are engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my promise, Carmina; but you make me uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my absence, you will be under my mother&rsquo;s care. And you don&rsquo;t like my
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Few words and plain words&mdash;and they sorely troubled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she owned that he was right, what would the consequence be? He might
      refuse to leave her. Even assuming that he controlled himself, he would
      take his departure harassed by anxieties, which might exercise the worst
      possible influence over the good effect of the journey. To prevaricate
      with herself or with him was out of the question. That very evening she
      had quarrelled with his mother; and she had yet to discover whether Mrs.
      Gallilee had forgiven her. In her heart of hearts she hated deceit&mdash;and
      in her heart of hearts she longed to set his mind at ease. In that
      embarrassing position, which was the right way out? Satan persuaded Eve;
      and Love persuaded Carmina. Love asked if she was cruel enough to make her
      heart&rsquo;s darling miserable when he was so fond of her? Before she could
      realise it, she had begun to deceive him. Poor humanity! poor Carmina!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are almost as hard on me as if you were Doctor Benjulia himself!&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I feel your mother&rsquo;s superiority&mdash;and you tell me I don&rsquo;t like
      her. Haven&rsquo;t you seen how good she has been to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought this way of putting it irresistible. Ovid resisted,
      nevertheless. Carmina plunged into lower depths of deceit immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen my pretty rooms&mdash;my piano&mdash;my pictures&mdash;my
      china&mdash;my flowers? I should be the most insensible creature living if
      I didn&rsquo;t feel grateful to your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, you are afraid of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook his arm impatiently. &ldquo;I say, No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was as obstinate as ever. &ldquo;I say, Yes! If you&rsquo;re not afraid, why do you
      wish to keep our engagement from my mother&rsquo;s knowledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His reasoning was unanswerable. But where is the woman to be found who is
      not supple enough to slip through the stiff fingers of Reason? She
      sheltered herself from his logic behind his language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I remind you again of the time when you were angry?&rdquo; she rejoined.
      &ldquo;You said your mother was bent on separating us. If I don&rsquo;t want her to
      know of our engagement just yet&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that a good reason?&rdquo; She
      rested her head caressingly on his shoulder. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she went on,
      thinking of one of Miss Minerva&rsquo;s suggestions, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t my aunt look to a
      higher marriage for you than a marriage with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to deny that Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s views might justify that
      inquiry. Had she not more than once advised him to wait a few years&mdash;in
      other words, to wait until he had won the highest honours of his
      profession&mdash;before he thought of marrying at all? But Carmina was too
      precious to him to be humiliated by comparisons with other women, no
      matter what their rank might be. He paid her a compliment, instead of
      giving her an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother can&rsquo;t look higher than you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish I could feel
      sure, Carmina&mdash;in leaving you with her&mdash;that I am leaving you
      with a friend whom you trust and love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sadness in his tone that grieved her. &ldquo;Wait till you come
      back,&rdquo; she replied, speaking as gaily as she could. &ldquo;You will be ashamed
      to remember your own misgivings. And don&rsquo;t forget, dear, that I have
      another friend besides your mother&mdash;the best and kindest of friends&mdash;to
      take care of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid heard this with some surprise. &ldquo;A friend in my mother&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; His tone expressed such immeasurable amazement, that Carmina&rsquo;s
      sense of justice was roused in defence of her new friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I began by wronging Miss Minerva, I had the excuse of being a
      stranger,&rdquo; she said, warmly. &ldquo;You have known her for years, and you ought
      to have found out her good qualities long since! Are all men alike, I
      wonder? Even my kind dear father used to call ugly women the inexcusable
      mistakes of Nature. Poor Miss Minerva says herself she is ugly, and
      expects everybody to misjudge her accordingly. I don&rsquo;t misjudge her, for
      one. Teresa has left me; and you are going away next. A miserable
      prospect, Ovid, but not quite without hope. Frances&mdash;yes, I call her
      by her Christian name, and she calls me by mine!&mdash;Frances will
      console me, and make my life as happy as it can be till you come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Excepting bad temper, and merciless cultivation of the minds of children,
      Ovid knew of nothing that justified his prejudice against the governess.
      Still, Carmina&rsquo;s sudden conversion inspired him with something like alarm.
      &ldquo;I suppose you have good reasons for what you tell me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best reasons,&rdquo; she replied, in the most positive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered for a moment how he could most delicately inquire what those
      reasons might be. But valuable opportunities may be lost, even in a
      moment. &ldquo;Will you help me to do justice to Miss Minerva?&rdquo; he cautiously
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Carmina interposed. &ldquo;Surely, I heard somebody calling to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They paused, and listened. A voice hailed them from the outer side of the
      garden. They started guiltily. It was the voice of Mrs. Gallilee.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Carmina! are you in the Square?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; Ovid whispered. &ldquo;We will come to you directly,&rdquo; he
      called back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee was waiting for them at the gate. Ovid spoke, the moment
      they were within sight of each other. &ldquo;You will have no more cause to
      complain of me,&rdquo; he said cheerfully; &ldquo;I am going away at the end of the
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s answer was addressed to Carmina instead of to her son.
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear,&rdquo; she said, and pressed her niece&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too dark to see more of faces than their shadowy outline. The
      learned lady&rsquo;s tone was the perfection of amiability. She sent Ovid across
      the road to knock at the house-door, and took Carmina&rsquo;s arm
      confidentially. &ldquo;You little goose!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;how could you suppose
      I was angry with you? I can&rsquo;t even regret your mistake, you have written
      such a charming note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid was waiting for them in the hall. They went into the library. Mrs.
      Gallilee enfolded her son in a fervent motherly embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This completes the enjoyment of a most delightful evening,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;First a perfect lecture&mdash;and then the relief of overpowering anxiety
      about my son. I suppose your professional studies, Ovid, have never taken
      you as high as the Interspacial Regions? We were an immense audience
      to-night, to hear the Professor on that subject, and I really haven&rsquo;t
      recovered it yet. Fifty miles above us&mdash;only fifty miles&mdash;there
      is an atmosphere of cold that would freeze the whole human family to death
      in a second of time. Moist matter, in that terrific emptiness, would
      explode, and become stone; and&mdash;listen to this, Carmina&mdash;the
      explosion itself would be frozen, and produce no sound. Think of serious
      people looking up in that dreadful direction, and talking of going to
      Heaven. Oh, the insignificance of man, except&mdash;I am going to make a
      joke, Ovid&mdash;except when he pleases his old mother by going away for
      the benefit of his health! And where are you going? Has sensible Carmina
      advised you? I agree with her beforehand, whatever she has said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid informed his mother of Benjulia&rsquo;s suggestion, and asked her what she
      thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s overflowing geniality instantly flooded the absent doctor.
      He was rude, he was ugly; but what an inestimable friend! what admirable
      advice! In Ovid&rsquo;s state of health he must not write letters; his mother
      would write and thank the doctor, and ask for introductions to local
      grandees who occupied a position in colonial society. She seized the
      newspaper: a steamer for Canada sailed from Liverpool on Saturday. Ovid
      could secure his cabin the next morning (&ldquo;amidships, my dear, if you can
      possibly get it&rdquo;), and could leave London by Friday&rsquo;s train. In her
      eagerness to facilitate his departure, she proposed to superintend the
      shutting up of his house, in his absence, and to arrange the disposal of
      the servants, if he considered it worth while to keep them. She even
      thought of the cat. The easiest way to provide for the creature would be
      of course to have her poisoned; but Ovid was so eccentric in some things,
      that practical suggestions were thrown away on him. &ldquo;Sixpence a week for
      cat&rsquo;s meat isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gallilee in an outburst of generosity.
      &ldquo;We will receive the cat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid made his acknowledgments resignedly. Carmina could see that Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s overpowering vitality was beginning to oppress her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t trouble you, mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My domestic affairs were all
      settled when I first felt the necessity of getting rest. My manservant
      travels with me. My housemaid and kitchenmaid will go to their friends in
      the country; the cook will look after the house; and her nephew, the
      little page, is almost as fond of the cat as I am. If you will send for a
      cab, I think I will go home. Like other people in my wretched state, I
      feel fatigued towards night-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips just touched Carmina&rsquo;s delicate little ear, while his mother
      turned away to ring the bell. &ldquo;Expect me to-morrow,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I love
      you!&mdash;love you!&mdash;love you!&rdquo; He seemed to find the perfection of
      luxury in the reiteration of those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ovid had left them, Carmina expected to hear something of her aunt&rsquo;s
      discovery in the Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s innocence was impenetrable. Not finding her niece in the
      house, she had thought of the Square. What could be more natural than that
      the cousins should take an evening walk, in one of the prettiest
      enclosures in London? Her anticipation of Ovid&rsquo;s recovery, and her
      admiration of Carmina&rsquo;s powers of persuasion appeared, for the time, to be
      the only active ideas in that comprehensive mind. When the servant brought
      in the tray, with the claret and soda-water, she sent for Miss Minerva to
      join them, and hear the good news; completely ignoring the interruption of
      their friendly relations, earlier in the evening. She became festive and
      facetious at the sight of the soda-water. &ldquo;Let us imitate the men, Miss
      Minerva, and drink a toast before we go to bed. Be cheerful, Carmina, and
      share half a bottle of soda-water with me. A pleasant journey to Ovid, and
      a safe return!&rdquo; Cheered by the influences of conviviality, the friend of
      Professors, the tender nurse of half-developed tadpoles, lapsed into
      learning again. Mrs. Gallilee improvised an appropriate little lecture on
      Canada&mdash;on the botany of the Dominion; on the geology of the
      Dominion; on the number of gallons of water wasted every hour by the falls
      of Niagara. &ldquo;Science will set it all right, my dears; we shall make that
      idle water work for us, one of these days. Good-night, Miss Minerva! Dear
      Carmina, pleasant dreams!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Safe in the solitude of her bedroom, the governess ominously knitted her
      heavy eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all my experience,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I never saw Mrs. Gallilee in such
      spirits before. What mischief is she meditating, when she has got rid of
      her son?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The lapse of a few hours exercised no deteriorating influence on Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s amiability.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, thanks to his mother&rsquo;s interference, Ovid was left in the
      undisturbed enjoyment of Carmina&rsquo;s society. Not only Miss Minerva, but
      even Mr. Gallilee and the children, were kept out of the way with a
      delicately-exercised dexterity, which defied the readiest suspicion to
      take offence. In one word, all that sympathy and indulgence could do to
      invite Ovid&rsquo;s confidence, was unobtrusively and modestly done. Never had
      the mistress of domestic diplomacy reached her ends with finer art.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, a messenger delivered Benjulia&rsquo;s reply to Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s announcement of her son&rsquo;s contemplated journey&mdash;despatched
      by the morning&rsquo;s post. The doctor was confined to the house by an attack
      of gout. If Ovid wanted information on the subject of Canada, Ovid must go
      to him, and get it. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever been to Doctor Benjulia&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; Carmina asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then all you have told me about him is mere report? Now you will find out
      the truth! Of course you will go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid felt no desire to make a voyage of exploration to Benjulia&rsquo;s house&mdash;and
      said so plainly. Carmina used all her powers of persuasion to induce him
      to change his mind. Mrs. Gallilee (superior to the influence of girlish
      curiosity) felt the importance of obtaining introductions to Canadian
      society, and agreed with her niece. &ldquo;I shall order the carriage,&rdquo; she
      said, assuming a playfully despotic tone; &ldquo;and, if you don&rsquo;t go to the
      doctor&mdash;Carmina and I will pay him a visit in your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Threatened, if he remained obstinate, with such a result as this, Ovid had
      no alternative but to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one order that could be given to the coachman was to drive to the
      village of Hendon, on the north-western side of London, and to trust to
      inquiries for the rest of the way. Between Hendon and Willesden, there are
      pastoral solitudes within an hour&rsquo;s drive of Oxford Street&mdash;wooded
      lanes and wild-flowers, farms and cornfields, still unprofaned by the
      devastating brickwork of the builder of modern times. Following winding
      ways, under shadowing trees, the coachman made his last inquiry at a
      roadside public-house. Hearing that Benjulia&rsquo;s place of abode was now
      within half a mile of him, Ovid set forth on foot; leaving the driver and
      the horses to take their ease at their inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at an iron gate, opening out of a lonely lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in the middle of a barren little field, he saw Benjulia&rsquo;s house&mdash;a
      hideous square building of yellow brick, with a slate roof. A low wall
      surrounded the place, having another iron gate at the entrance. The
      enclosure within was as barren as the field without: not even an attempt
      at flower-garden or kitchen-garden was visible. At a distance of some two
      hundred yards from the house stood a second and smaller building, with a
      skylight in the roof, which Ovid recognised (from description) as the
      famous laboratory. Behind it was the hedge which parted Benjulia&rsquo;s morsel
      of land from the land of his neighbour. Here, the trees rose again, and
      the fields beyond were cultivated. No dwellings, and no living creatures
      appeared. So near to London&mdash;and yet, in its loneliness, so far away&mdash;there
      was something unnatural in the solitude of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Led by a feeling of curiosity, which was fast degenerating into suspicion,
      Ovid approached the laboratory, without showing himself in front of the
      house. No watch-dog barked; no servant appeared on the look-out for a
      visitor. He was ashamed of himself as he did it, but (so strongly had he
      been impressed by Carmina&rsquo;s observation of the doctor) he even tried the
      locked door of the laboratory, and waited and listened! It was a breezy
      summer-day; the leaves of the trees near him rustled cheerfully. Was there
      another sound audible? Yes&mdash;low and faint, there rose through the
      sweet woodland melody a moaning cry. It paused; it was repeated; it
      stopped. He looked round him, not quite sure whether the sound proceeded
      from the outside or the inside of the building. He shook the door. Nothing
      happened. The suffering creature (if it was a suffering creature) was
      silent or dead. Had chemical experiment accidentally injured some living
      thing? Or&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      He recoiled from pursuing that second inquiry. The laboratory had, by this
      time, become an object of horror to him. He returned to the
      dwelling-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand on the latch of the gate, and looked back at the
      laboratory. He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      That moaning cry, so piteous and so short-lived, haunted his ears. The
      idea of approaching Benjulia became repellent to him. What he might
      afterwards think of himself&mdash;what his mother and Carmina might think
      of him&mdash;if he returned without having entered the doctors&rsquo; house,
      were considerations which had no influence over his mind, in its present
      mood. The impulse of the moment was the one power that swayed him. He put
      the latch back in the socket. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go in,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late. As he turned from the house a manservant appeared at the
      door&mdash;crossed the enclosure&mdash;and threw the gate open for Ovid,
      without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the passage. The speechless manservant opened a door on the
      right, and made a bow, inviting the visitor to enter. Ovid found himself
      in a room as barren as the field outside. There were the plastered walls,
      there was the bare floor, left exactly as the builders had left them when
      the house was finished. After a short absence, the man appeared again. He
      might be depressed in spirits, or crabbed in temper: the fact remained
      that, even now, he had nothing to say. He opened a door on the opposite
      side of the passage&mdash;made another bow&mdash;and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near me!&rdquo; cried Benjulia, the moment Ovid showed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was seated in an inner corner of the room; robed in a long
      black dressing-gown, buttoned round his throat, which hid every part of
      him below his fleshless face, except his big hands, and his tortured gouty
      foot. Rage and pain glared in his gloomy gray eyes, and shook his clenched
      fists, resting on the arms of an easy chair. &ldquo;Ten thousand red-hot devils
      are boring ten thousand holes through my foot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you touch the
      pillow on my stool, I shall fly at your throat.&rdquo; He poured some cooling
      lotion from a bottle into a small watering-pot, and irrigated his foot as
      if it had been a bed of flowers. By way of further relief to the pain, he
      swore ferociously; addressing his oaths to himself, in thunderous
      undertones which made the glasses ring on the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved, in his present frame of mind, to have escaped the necessity of
      shaking hands, Ovid took a chair, and looked about him. Even here he
      discovered but little furniture, and that little of the heavy
      old-fashioned sort. Besides the sideboard, he perceived a dining-table,
      six chairs, and a dingy brown carpet. There were no curtains on the
      window, and no pictures or prints on the drab-coloured walls. The empty
      grate showed its bleak black cavity undisguised; and the mantelpiece had
      nothing on it but the doctor&rsquo;s dirty and strong-smelling pipe. Benjulia
      set down his watering-pot, as a sign that the paroxysm of pain had passed
      away. &ldquo;A dull place to live in, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; In those words he welcomed the
      visitor to his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritated by the accident which had forced him into the repellent presence
      of Benjulia, Ovid answered in a tone which matched the doctor on his own
      hard ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own fault if the place is dull. Why haven&rsquo;t you planted trees,
      and laid out a garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I shall surprise you,&rdquo; Benjulia quietly rejoined; &ldquo;but I have
      a habit of speaking my mind. I don&rsquo;t object to a dull place; and I don&rsquo;t
      care about trees and gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to care about furniture either,&rdquo; said Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he was out of pain for awhile, the doctor&rsquo;s innate insensibility
      to what other people might think of him, or might say to him, resumed its
      customary torpor in its own strangely unconscious way. He seemed only to
      understand that Ovid&rsquo;s curiosity was in search of information about
      trifles. Well, there would be less trouble in giving him his information,
      than in investigating his motives. So Benjulia talked of his furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My sister-in-law&mdash;did you know I
      had a relation of that sort?&mdash;my sister-in-law got the tables and
      chairs, and beds and basins. Buying things at shops doesn&rsquo;t interest me. I
      gave her a cheque; and I told her to furnish a room for me to eat in, and
      a room for me to sleep in&mdash;and not to forget the kitchen and the
      garrets for the servants. What more do I want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His intolerable composure only added to his guest&rsquo;s irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A selfish way of putting it,&rdquo; Ovid broke out. &ldquo;Have you nobody to think
      of but yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&mdash;I am happy to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s downright cynicism, Benjulia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor reflected. &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps you may be right again. I
      think it&rsquo;s only indifference, myself. Curiously enough my brother looks at
      it from your point of view&mdash;he even used the same word that you used
      just now. I suppose he found my cynicism beyond the reach of reform. At
      any rate, he left off coming here. I got rid of <i>him</i> on easy terms.
      What do you say? That inhuman way of talking is unworthy of me? Really I
      don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;m not a downright savage. It&rsquo;s only indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your brother return your indifference? You must be a nice pair, if
      he does!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia seemed to find a certain dreary amusement in considering the
      question that Ovid had proposed. He decided on doing justice to his absent
      relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s intelligence is perhaps equal to such a small effort as you
      suggest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has just brains enough to keep himself out of an
      asylum for idiots. Shall I tell you what he is in two words? A stupid
      sensualist&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he is. I let his wife come here sometimes,
      and cry. It doesn&rsquo;t trouble <i>me;</i> and it seems to relieve <i>her.</i>
      More of my indifference&mdash;eh? Well, I don&rsquo;t know. I gave her the
      change out of the furniture-cheque, to buy a new bonnet with. You might
      call that indifference, and you might be right once more. I don&rsquo;t care
      about money. Will you have a drink? You see I can&rsquo;t move. Please ring for
      the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid refused the drink, and changed the subject. &ldquo;Your servant is a
      remarkably silent person,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his merit,&rdquo; Benjulia answered; &ldquo;the women-servants have quarrelled
      with every other man I&rsquo;ve had. They can&rsquo;t quarrel with this man. I have
      raised his wages in grateful acknowledgment of his usefulness to me. I
      hate noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the reason why you don&rsquo;t keep a watch-dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like dogs. They bark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had apparently some other disagreeable association with dogs, which he
      was not disposed to communicate. His hollow eyes stared gloomily into
      vacancy. Ovid&rsquo;s presence in the room seemed to have become, for the time
      being, an impression erased from his mind. He recovered himself, with the
      customary vehement rubbing of his head, and turned the talk to the object
      of Ovid&rsquo;s visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have taken my advice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to Canada, and you
      want to get at what I can tell you before you start. Here&rsquo;s my journal. It
      will jog my memory, and help us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His writing materials were placed on a movable table, screwed to his
      chair. Near them lay a shabby-looking book, guarded by a lock. Ten minutes
      after he had opened his journal, and had looked here and there through the
      pages, his hard intellect had grasped all that it required. Steadily and
      copiously his mind emptied its information into Ovid&rsquo;s mind; without a
      single digression from beginning to end, and with the most mercilessly
      direct reference to the traveller&rsquo;s practical wants. Not a word escaped
      him, relating to national character or to the beauties of Nature. Mrs.
      Gallilee had criticized the Falls of Niagara as a reservoir of wasted
      power. Doctor Benjulia&rsquo;s scientific superiority over the woman asserted
      itself with magnificent ease. Niagara being nothing but useless water, he
      never mentioned Niagara at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I served your purpose as a guide?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Never mind thanking
      me. Yes or no will do. Very good. I have got a line of writing to give you
      next.&rdquo; He mended his quill pen, and made an observation. &ldquo;Have you ever
      noticed that women have one pleasure which lasts to the end of their
      lives?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Young and old, they have the same inexhaustible
      enjoyment of society; and, young and old, they are all alike incapable of
      understanding a man, when he says he doesn&rsquo;t care to go to a party. Even
      your clever mother thinks you want to go to parties in Canada.&rdquo; He tried
      his pen, and found it would do&mdash;and began his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing his hands at work, Ovid was again reminded of Carmina&rsquo;s discovery.
      His eyes wandered a little aside, towards the corner formed by the pillar
      of the chimney-piece and the wall of the room. The big bamboo-stick rested
      there. A handle was attached to it, made of light-coloured horn, and on
      that handle there were some stains. Ovid looked at them with a surgeon&rsquo;s
      practised eye. They were dry stains of blood. (Had he washed his hands on
      the last occasion when he used his stick? And had he forgotten that the
      handle wanted washing too?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia finished his letter, and wrote the address. He took up the
      envelope, to give it to Ovid&mdash;and stopped, as if some doubt tempted
      him to change his mind. The hesitation was only momentary. He persisted in
      his first intention, and gave Ovid the letter. It was addressed to a
      doctor at Montreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man won&rsquo;t introduce you to society,&rdquo; Benjulia announced, &ldquo;and won&rsquo;t
      worry your brains with medical talk. Keep off one subject on your side. A
      mad bull is nothing to my friend if you speak of Vivisection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid looked at him steadily, when he uttered the last word. Benjulia
      looked back, just as steadily at Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of that reciprocal scrutiny, did the two men suspect each
      other? Ovid, on his side, determined not to leave the house without
      putting his suspicions to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for the letter,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;and I will not forget the
      warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s capacity for the exercise of the social virtues had its
      limits. His reserves of hospitality were by this time near their end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything more I can do for you?&rdquo; he interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can answer a simple question,&rdquo; Ovid replied. &ldquo;My cousin Carmina&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia interrupted him again: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we said enough about your
      cousin in the Gardens?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid acknowledged the hint with a neatness of retort almost worthy of his
      mother. &ldquo;You have your own merciful disposition to blame, if I return to
      the subject,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;My cousin cannot forget your kindness to the
      monkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner she forgets my kindness the better. The monkey is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the creature was living in pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I heard a moaning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the building behind your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard the wind in the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort. Are your chemical experiments ever made on animals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor parried that direct attack, without giving ground by so much as
      a hair&rsquo;s breadth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say when I gave you your letter of introduction?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I
      said, A mad bull is nothing to my friend, if you speak to him of
      Vivisection. Now I have something more to tell you. I am like my friend.&rdquo;
       He waited a little. &ldquo;Will that do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ovid; &ldquo;that will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were as near to an open quarrel as two men could be: Ovid took up his
      hat to go. Even at that critical moment, Benjulia&rsquo;s strange jealousy of
      his young colleague&mdash;as a possible rival in some field of discovery
      which he claimed as his own&mdash;showed itself once more. There was no
      change in his tone; he still spoke like a judicious friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A last word of advice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are travelling for your health;
      don&rsquo;t let inquisitive strangers lead you into talk. Some of them might be
      physiologists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And might suggest new ideas,&rdquo; Ovid rejoined, determined to make him speak
      out this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia nodded, in perfect agreement with his guest&rsquo;s view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid of new ideas?&rdquo; Ovid went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am&mdash;in <i>your</i> head.&rdquo; He made that admission, without
      hesitation or embarrassment. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;My sensitive foot
      feels noises: don&rsquo;t bang the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Getting out into the lane again, Ovid looked at his letter to the doctor
      at Montreal. His first impulse was to destroy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Benjulia had hesitated before giving him the letter, so he now
      hesitated before tearing it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to the usual practice in such cases, the envelope was closed.
      Under those circumstances, Ovid&rsquo;s pride decided him on using the
      introduction. Time was still to pass, before events opened his eyes to the
      importance of his decision. To the end of his life he remembered that
      Benjulia had been near to keeping back the letter, and that he had been
      near to tearing it up.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The wise ancient who asserted that &ldquo;Time flies,&rdquo; must have made that
      remarkable discovery while he was in a state of preparation for a journey.
      When are we most acutely sensible of the shortness of life? When do we
      consult our watches in perpetual dread of the result? When does the night
      steal on us unawares, and the morning take us by surprise? When we are
      going on a journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining days of the week went by with a rush. Ovid had hardly time
      to ask himself if Friday had really come, before the hours of his life at
      home were already numbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had still a little time to spare when he presented himself at Fairfield
      Gardens late in the afternoon. Finding no one in the library, he went up
      to the drawing-room. His mother was alone, reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to say to me, before I tell Carmina that you are here?&rdquo;
       Mrs. Gallilee put that question quietly, so far as her voice was
      concerned. But she still kept her eyes on her book. Ovid knew that she was
      offering him his first and last chance of speaking plainly, before he went
      away. In Carmina&rsquo;s interests he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am leaving the one person in the world who is most
      precious to me, under your care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee asked, &ldquo;that you and Carmina are engaged to
      be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that; and I am not sure that you approve of the engagement. Will
      you be plainer with me than you were on the last occasion when we spoke on
      this subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you and I were alone for a few minutes, on the morning when I
      breakfasted here. You said it was quite natural that Carmina should have
      attracted me; but you were careful not to encourage the idea of a marriage
      between us. I understood that you disapproved of it&mdash;but you didn&rsquo;t
      plainly tell me why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can women always give their reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;when they are women like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear, for a pretty compliment. I can trust my memory. I
      think I hinted at the obvious objections to an engagement. You and Carmina
      are cousins; and you belong to different religious communities. I may add
      that a man with your brilliant prospects has, in my opinion, no reason to
      marry unless his wife is in a position to increase his influence and
      celebrity. I had looked forward to seeing my clever son rise more nearly
      to a level with persons of rank, who are members of our family. There is
      my confession, Ovid. If I did hesitate on the occasion to which you have
      referred, I have now, I think, told you why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that you hesitate still?&rdquo; Ovid asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; With that brief reply she rose to put away her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid followed her to the bookcase. &ldquo;Has Carmina conquered you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her book back in its place. &ldquo;Carmina has conquered me,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say it coldly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that matter, if I say it truly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The struggle in him between hope and fear burst its way out. &ldquo;Oh, mother,
      no words can tell you how fond I am of Carmina! For God&rsquo;s sake take care
      of her, and be kind to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For <i>your</i> sake,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee, gently correcting the language
      of her excitable son, from her own protoplastic point of view. &ldquo;You do me
      an injustice if you feel anxious about Carmina, when you leave her here.
      My dead brother&rsquo;s child, is <i>my</i> child. You may be sure of that.&rdquo; She
      took his hand, and drew him to her, and kissed his forehead with dignity
      and deliberation. If Mr. Mool had been present, during the registration of
      that solemn pledge, he would have been irresistibly reminded of the other
      ceremony, which is called signing a deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any instructions to give me?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee proceeded. &ldquo;For
      instance, do you object to my taking Carmina to parties? I mean, of
      course, parties which will improve her mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell sadly below his mother&rsquo;s level in replying to this. &ldquo;Do everything
      you can to make her life happy while I am away.&rdquo; Those were his only
      instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Gallilee had not done with him yet. &ldquo;With regard to visitors,&rdquo;
       she went on, &ldquo;I presume you wish me to be careful, if I find young men
      calling here oftener than usual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid actually laughed at this. &ldquo;Do you think I doubt her?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The
      earth doesn&rsquo;t hold a truer girl than my little Carmina!&rdquo; A thought struck
      him while he said it. The brightness faded out of his face; his voice lost
      its gaiety. &ldquo;There is one person who may call on you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whom I
      don&rsquo;t wish her to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, he is a man who has excited her curiosity. I mean
      Benjulia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s turn to be amused. Her laugh was not one of her
      foremost fascinations. It was hard in tone, and limited in range&mdash;it
      opened her mouth, but it failed to kindle any light in her eyes. &ldquo;Jealous
      of the ugly doctor!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, Ovid, what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never made a greater mistake in your life,&rdquo; her son answered sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is the objection to him?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy to meet that question with a plain reply. If Ovid asserted
      that Benjulia&rsquo;s chemical experiments were assumed&mdash;for some reason
      known only to himself&mdash;as a cloak to cover the atrocities of the
      Savage Science, he would only raise the doctor in his mother&rsquo;s estimation.
      If, on the other hand, he described what had passed between them when they
      met in the Zoological Gardens, Mrs. Gallilee might summon Benjulia to
      explain the slur which he had indirectly cast on the memory of Carmina&rsquo;s
      mother&mdash;and might find, in the reply, some plausible reason for
      objecting to her son&rsquo;s marriage. Having rashly placed himself in this
      dilemma, Ovid unwisely escaped from it by the easiest way. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      Benjulia a fit person,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be in the company of a young girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee accepted this expression of opinion with a readiness, which
      would have told a more suspicious man that he had made a mistake. Ovid had
      roused the curiosity&mdash;perhaps awakened the distrust&mdash;of his
      clever mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know best,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee replied; &ldquo;I will bear in mind what you
      say.&rdquo; She rang the bell for Carmina, and left the room. Ovid found the
      minutes passing slowly, for the first time since the day had been fixed
      for his departure. He attributed this impression to his natural impatience
      for the appearance of his cousin&mdash;until the plain evidence of the
      clock pointed to a delay of five endless minutes, and more. As he
      approached the door to make inquiries, it opened at last. Hurrying to meet
      Carmina, he found himself face to face with Miss Minerva!
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in hastily, and held out her hand without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for intruding on you,&rdquo; she said, with a rapidity of utterance
      and a timidity of manner strangely unlike herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m obliged to prepare
      the children&rsquo;s lessons for to-morrow; and this is my only opportunity of
      bidding you good-bye. You have my best wishes&mdash;my heartfelt wishes&mdash;for
      your safety and your health, and&mdash;and your enjoyment of the journey.
      Good-bye! good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After holding his hand for a moment, she hastened back to the door. There
      she stopped, turned towards him again, and looked at him for the first
      time. &ldquo;I have one thing more to say,&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;I will do all I can
      to make Carmina&rsquo;s life pleasant in your absence.&rdquo; Before he could thank
      her, she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute Carmina came in, and found Ovid looking perplexed and
      annoyed. She had passed Frances on the stairs&mdash;had there been any
      misunderstanding between Ovid and the governess?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Miss Minerva?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm round her, and seated her by him on the sofa. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      understand Miss Minerva,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How is it that she came here, when I
      was expecting You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She asked me, as a favour, to let her see you first; and she seemed to be
      so anxious about it that I gave way. I didn&rsquo;t do wrong, Ovid&mdash;did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, you are always kind, and always right! But why couldn&rsquo;t she
      say good-bye (with the others) downstairs? Do <i>you</i> understand this
      curious woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo; She paused, and toyed with the hair over Ovid&rsquo;s forehead.
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva is fond of you, poor thing,&rdquo; she said innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fond of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surprise which his tone expressed, failed to attract her attention.
      She quietly varied the phrase that she had just used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva has a true regard for you&mdash;and knows that you don&rsquo;t
      return it,&rdquo; she explained, still playing with Ovid&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;I want to see
      how it looks,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s parted in the middle. No! it looks
      better as you always wear it. How handsome you are, Ovid! Don&rsquo;t you wish I
      was beautiful, too? Everybody in the house loves you; and everybody is
      sorry you are going away. I like Miss Minerva, I like everybody, for being
      so fond of my dear, dear hero. Oh, what shall I do when day after day
      passes, and only takes you farther and farther away from me? No! I won&rsquo;t
      cry. You shan&rsquo;t go away with a heavy heart, my dear one, if I can help it.
      Where is your photograph? You promised me your photograph. Let me look at
      it. Yes! it&rsquo;s like you, and yet not like you. It will do to think over,
      when I am alone. My love, it has copied your eyes, but it has not copied
      the divine kindness and goodness that I see in them!&rdquo; She paused, and laid
      her head on his bosom. &ldquo;I shall cry, in spite of my resolution, if I look
      at you any longer. We won&rsquo;t look&mdash;we won&rsquo;t talk&mdash;I can feel your
      arm round me&mdash;I can hear your heart. Silence is best. I have been
      told of people dying happily; and I never understood it before. I think I
      could die happily now.&rdquo; She put her hand over his lips before he could
      reprove her, and nestled closer to him. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said softly; &ldquo;hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They neither moved nor spoke: that silent happiness was the best
      happiness, while it lasted. Mrs. Gallilee broke the charm. She suddenly
      opened the door, pointed to the clock, and went away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cruel time had come. They made their last promises; shared their last
      kisses; held each other in the last embrace. She threw herself on the
      sofa, as he left her&mdash;with a gesture which entreated him to go, while
      she could still control herself. Once, he looked round, when he reached
      the door&mdash;and then it was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone on the landing, he dashed the tears away from his eyes. Suffering
      and sorrow tried hard to get the better of his manhood: they had shaken,
      but had not conquered him. He was calm, when he joined the members of the
      family, waiting in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perpetually setting an example, Mrs. Gallilee ascended her domestic
      pedestal as usual. She favoured her son with one more kiss, and reminded
      him of the railway. &ldquo;We understand each other, Ovid&mdash;you have only
      five minutes to spare. Write, when you get to Quebec. Now, Maria! say
      good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria presented herself to her brother with a grace which did honour to
      the family dancing-master. Her short farewell speech was a model of its
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Ovid, I am only a child; but I feel truly anxious for the recovery
      of your health. At this favourable season you may look forward to a
      pleasant voyage. Please accept my best wishes.&rdquo; She offered her cheek to
      be kissed&mdash;and looked like a young person who had done her duty, and
      knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee&mdash;modestly secluded behind the window curtains&mdash;appeared,
      at a sign from his wife. One of his plump red hands held a bundle of
      cigars. The other clutched an enormous new travelling-flask&mdash;the
      giant of its tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, it&rsquo;s possible there may be good brandy and cigars on board;
      but that&rsquo;s not my experience of steamers&mdash;is it yours?&rdquo; He stopped to
      consult his wife. &ldquo;My dear, is it yours?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee held up the
      &ldquo;Railway Guide,&rdquo; and shook it significantly. Mr. Gallilee went on in a
      hurry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some of the right stuff in this flask, Ovid, if you will
      accept it. Five-and-forty years old&mdash;would you like to taste it?
      Would you like to taste it, my dear?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee seized the &ldquo;Railway
      Guide&rdquo; again, with a terrible look. Her husband crammed the big flask into
      one of Ovid&rsquo;s pockets, and the cigars into the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find them a
      comfort when you&rsquo;re away from us. God bless you, my son! You don&rsquo;t mind my
      calling you my son? I couldn&rsquo;t be fonder of you, if I really was your
      father. Let&rsquo;s part as cheerfully as we can,&rdquo; said poor Mr. Gallilee, with
      the tears rolling undisguisedly over his fat cheeks. &ldquo;We can write to each
      other&mdash;can&rsquo;t we? Oh dear! dear! I wish I could take it as easy as
      Maria does. Zo! come and give him a kiss, poor fellow. Where&rsquo;s Zo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee made the discovery&mdash;she dragged Zo into view, from
      under the table. Ovid took his little sister on his knee, and asked why
      she had hidden herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to say good-bye!&rdquo; cried the child, giving her reason
      with a passionate outbreak of sorrow that shook her from head to foot.
      &ldquo;Take me with you, Ovid, take me with you!&rdquo; He did his best to console
      her, under adverse circumstances. Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s warning voice sounded
      like a knell&mdash;&ldquo;Time! time!&rdquo; Zo&rsquo;s shrill treble rang out louder still.
      Zo was determined to write to Ovid, if she was not allowed to go with him.
      &ldquo;Pa&rsquo;s going to write to you&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she screamed through
      her tears. &ldquo;Dear Zoe, you are too young,&rdquo; Maria remarked. &ldquo;Damned
      nonsense!&rdquo; sobbed Mr. Gallilee; &ldquo;she <i>shall</i> write!&rdquo; &ldquo;Time, time!&rdquo;
       Mrs. Gallilee reiterated. Taking no part in the dispute, Ovid directed two
      envelopes for Zo, and quieted her in that way. He hurried into the hall;
      he glanced at the stairs that led to the drawing-room. Carmina was on the
      landing, waiting for a farewell look at him. On the higher flight of
      stairs, invisible from the hall, Miss Minerva was watching the scene of
      departure. Reckless of railways and steamers, Ovid ran up to Carmina.
      Another and another kiss; and then away to the house-door, with Zo at his
      heels, trying to get into the cab with him. A last kind word to the child,
      as they carried her back to the house; a last look at the familiar faces
      in the doorway; a last effort to resist that foretaste of death which
      embitters all human partings&mdash;and Ovid was gone!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the day that followed Ovid&rsquo;s departure, the three
      ladies of the household were in a state of retirement&mdash;each in her
      own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writing-table in Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s boudoir was covered with letters. Her
      banker&rsquo;s pass-book and her cheque-book were on the desk; Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s
      affairs having been long since left as completely in the hands of his
      wife, as if Mr. Gallilee had been dead. A sheet of paper lay near the
      cheque-book, covered with calculations divided into two columns. The
      figures in the right-hand column were contained in one line at the top of
      the page. The figures in the left-hand column filled the page from top to
      bottom. With her fan in her hand, and her pen in the ink-bottle, Mrs.
      Gallilee waited, steadily thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hottest day of the season. All the fat women in London fanned
      themselves on that sultry afternoon; and Mrs. Gallilee followed the
      general example. When she looked to the right, her calculations showed the
      balance at the bank. When she looked to the left, her calculations showed
      her debts: some partially paid, some not paid at all. If she wearied of
      the prospect thus presented, and turned for relief to her letters, she was
      confronted by polite requests for money; from tradespeople in the first
      place, and from secretaries of fashionable Charities in the second. Here
      and there, by way of variety, were invitations to parties, representing
      more pecuniary liabilities, incurred for new dresses, and for
      hospitalities acknowledged by dinners and conversaziones at her own house.
      Money that she owed, money that she must spend; nothing but outlay of
      money&mdash;and where was it to come from?
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as her pecuniary resources were concerned, she was equally removed
      from hope and fear. Twice a year the same income flowed in regularly from
      the same investments. What she could pay at any future time was far more
      plainly revealed to her than what she might owe. With tact and management
      it would be possible to partially satisfy creditors, and keep up
      appearances for six months more. To that conclusion her reflections led
      her, and left her to write cheques.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after the six months&mdash;what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Having first completed her correspondence with the tradespeople, and
      having next decided on her contributions to the Charities, this iron
      matron took up her fan again, cooled herself, and met the question of the
      future face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid was the central figure in the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he lived devoted to his profession, and lived unmarried, there was a
      last resource always left to Mrs. Gallilee. For years past, his
      professional gains had added largely to the income which he had inherited
      from his father. Unembarrassed by expensive tastes, he had some thousands
      of pounds put by&mdash;for the simple reason that he was at a loss what
      else to do with them. Thus far, her brother&rsquo;s generosity had spared Mrs.
      Gallilee the hard necessity of making a confession to her son. As things
      were now, she must submit to tell the humiliating truth; and Ovid (with no
      wife to check <i>his</i> liberal instincts) would do what Ovid&rsquo;s uncle
      (with no wife living to check his liberal instincts) had done already.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the prospect, if her son remained a bachelor. But her son had
      resolved to marry Carmina. What would be the result if she was weak enough
      to allow it?
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be, not one result, but three results. Natural; Legal;
      Pecuniary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural result would be&mdash;children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legal result (if only one of those children lived) would be the loss
      to Mrs. Gallilee and her daughters of the splendid fortune reserved for
      them in the Will, if Carmina died without leaving offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pecuniary result would be (adding the husband&rsquo;s income to the wife&rsquo;s)
      about eight thousand a year for the young married people.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how much for a loan, applicable to the mother-in-law&rsquo;s creditors?
      Judging Carmina by the standard of herself&mdash;by what other standard do
      we really judge our fellow-creatures, no matter how clever we may be?&mdash;Mrs.
      Gallilee decided that not one farthing would be left to help her to pay
      debts, which were steadily increasing with every new concession that she
      made to the claims of society. Young Mrs. Ovid Vere, at the head of a
      household, would have the grand example of her other aunt before her eyes.
      Although her place of residence might not be a palace, she would be a poor
      creature indeed, if she failed to spend eight thousand a year, in the
      effort to be worthy of the social position of Lady Northlake. Add to these
      results of Ovid&rsquo;s contemplated marriage the loss of a thousand a year,
      secured to the guardian by the Will, while the ward remained under her
      care&mdash;and the statement of disaster would be complete. &ldquo;We must leave
      this house, and submit to be Lady Northlake&rsquo;s poor relations&mdash;there
      is the price I pay for it, if Ovid and Carmina become man and wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She quietly laid aside her fan, as the thought in her completed itself in
      this form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trivial action, and the look which accompanied it, had a sinister
      meaning of their own, beyond the reach of words. And Ovid was already on
      the sea. And Teresa was far away in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock on the mantelpiece struck five; the punctual parlour-maid
      appeared with her mistress&rsquo;s customary cup of tea. Mrs. Gallilee asked for
      the governess. The servant answered that Miss Minerva was in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the young ladies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master has taken them out for a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they had their music lesson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, ma&rsquo;am. Mr. Le Frank left word yesterday that he would come at
      six this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mr. Gallilee know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Miss Minerva tell my master, while I was helping the young ladies
      to get ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Ask Miss Minerva to come here, and speak to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva sat at the open window of her bedroom, looking out vacantly
      at the backs of houses, in the street behind Fairfield Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil spirit was the dominant spirit in her again. She, too, was
      thinking of Ovid and Carmina. Her memory was busy with the parting scene
      on the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more she thought of all that had happened in that short space of time,
      the more bitterly she reproached herself. Her one besetting weakness had
      openly degraded her, without so much as an attempt at resistance on her
      part. The fear of betraying herself if she took leave of the man she
      secretly loved, in the presence of his family, had forced her to ask a
      favour of Carmina, and to ask it under circumstances which might have led
      her rival to suspect the truth. Admitted to a private interview with Ovid,
      she had failed to control her agitation; and, worse still, in her
      ungovernable eagerness to produce a favourable impression on him at
      parting, she had promised&mdash;honestly promised, in that moment of
      impulse&mdash;to make Carmina&rsquo;s happiness her own peculiar care! Carmina,
      who had destroyed in a day the hope of years! Carmina, who had taken him
      away from her; who had clung round him when he ran upstairs, and had
      kissed him&mdash;fervently, shamelessly kissed him&mdash;before the
      servants in the hall!
    </p>
    <p>
      She started to her feet, roused to a frenzy of rage by her own
      recollections. Standing at the window, she looked down at the pavement of
      the courtyard&mdash;it was far enough below to kill her instantly if she
      fell on it. Through the heat of her anger there crept the chill and
      stealthy prompting of despair. She leaned over the window-sill&mdash;she
      was not afraid&mdash;she might have done it, but for a trifling
      interruption. Somebody spoke outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the parlour-maid. Instead of entering the room, she spoke through
      the open door. The woman was one of Miss Minerva&rsquo;s many enemies in the
      house. &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee wishes to see you,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and shut the door
      again, the instant the words were out of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee!
    </p>
    <p>
      The very name was full of promise at that moment. It suggested hope&mdash;merciless
      hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the window, and consulted her looking-glass. Even to herself, her
      haggard face was terrible to see. She poured eau-de-cologne and water into
      her basin, and bathed her burning head and eyes. Her shaggy black hair
      stood in need of attention next. She took almost as much pains with it as
      if she had been going into the presence of Ovid himself. &ldquo;I must make a
      calm appearance,&rdquo; she thought, still as far as ever from suspecting that
      her employer had guessed her secret, &ldquo;or his mother may find me out.&rdquo; Her
      knees trembled under her. She sat down for a minute to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she merely wanted for some ordinary domestic consultation? or was
      there really a chance of hearing the question of Ovid and Carmina brought
      forward at the coming interview?
    </p>
    <p>
      She believed what she hoped: she believed that the time had come when Mrs.
      Gallilee had need of an ally&mdash;perhaps of an accomplice. Only let her
      object be the separation of the two cousins&mdash;and Miss Minerva was
      eager to help her, in either capacity. Suppose she was too cautious to
      mention her object? Miss Minerva was equally ready for her employer, in
      that case. The doubt which had prompted her fruitless suggestions to
      Carmina, when they were alone in the young girl&rsquo;s room&mdash;the doubt
      whether a clue to the discovery of Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s motives might not be
      found, in that latter part of the Will which she had failed to overhear&mdash;was
      as present as ever in the governess&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;The learned lady is not
      infallible,&rdquo; she thought as she entered Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;If one
      unwary word trips over her tongue, I shall pick it up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s manner was encouraging at the outset. She had left her
      writing-table; and she now presented herself, reclining in an easy chair,
      weary and discouraged&mdash;the picture of a woman in want of a helpful
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head aches with adding up figures, and writing letters,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      wish you would finish my correspondence for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva took her place at the desk. She at once discovered the
      unfinished correspondence to be a false pretence. Three cheques for
      charitable subscriptions, due at that date, were waiting to be sent to
      three secretaries, with the customary letters. In five minutes, the
      letters were ready for the post. &ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; Miss Minerva asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I remember. Do you mind giving me my fan? I feel perfectly
      helpless&mdash;I am wretchedly depressed to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heat, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The expenses. Every year, the demands on our resources seem to
      increase. On principle, I dislike living up to our income&mdash;and I am
      obliged to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, plainly revealed to the governess&rsquo;s experienced eyes, was another
      false pretence&mdash;used to introduce the true object of the interview,
      as something which might accidentally suggest itself in the course of
      conversation. Miss Minerva expressed the necessary regret with innocent
      readiness. &ldquo;Might I suggest economy?&rdquo; she asked with impenetrable gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirably advised,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee admitted; &ldquo;but how is it to be done?
      Those subscriptions, for instance, are more than I ought to give. And what
      happens if I lower the amount? I expose myself to unfavourable comparison
      with other people of our rank in society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva still patiently played the part expected of her. &ldquo;You might
      perhaps do with only one carriage-horse,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good creature, look at the people who have only one carriage-horse!
      Situated as I am, can I descend to that level? Don&rsquo;t suppose I care two
      straws about such things, myself. My one pride and pleasure in life is the
      pride and pleasure of improving my mind. But I have Lady Northlake for a
      sister; and I must not be entirely unworthy of my family connections. I
      have two daughters; and I must think of their interests. In a few years,
      Maria will be presented at Court. Thanks to you, she will be one of the
      most accomplished girls in England. Think of Maria&rsquo;s mother in a one-horse
      chaise. Dear child! tell me all about her lessons. Is she getting on as
      well as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Examine her yourself, Mrs. Gallilee. I can answer for the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Minerva! I have too much confidence in you to do anything of the
      kind. Besides, in one of the most important of Maria&rsquo;s accomplishments, I
      am entirely dependent on yourself. I know nothing of music. You are not
      responsible for her progress in that direction. Still, I should like to
      know if you are satisfied with Maria&rsquo;s music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think she is getting&mdash;how can I express it?&mdash;shall I
      say beyond the reach of Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s teaching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would consider Mr. Le Frank equal to the instruction of an
      older and more advanced pupil than Maria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, Miss Minerva had answered the questions submitted to her with
      well-concealed indifference. This last inquiry roused her attention. Why
      did Mrs. Gallilee show an interest, for the first time, in Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s
      capacity as a teacher? Who was this &ldquo;older and more advanced pupil,&rdquo; for
      whose appearance in the conversation the previous questions had so
      smoothly prepared the way? Feeling delicate ground under her, the
      governess advanced cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always thought Mr. Le Frank an excellent teacher,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give me no more definite answer than that?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite unacquainted, madam, with the musical proficiency of the pupil
      to whom you refer. I don&rsquo;t even know (which adds to my perplexity) whether
      you are speaking of a lady or a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee quietly, &ldquo;of my niece, Carmina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words set all further doubt at rest in Miss Minerva&rsquo;s mind.
      Introduced by such elaborate preparation, the allusion to Carmina&rsquo;s name
      could only lead, in due course, to the subject of Carmina&rsquo;s marriage. By
      indirect methods of approach, Mrs. Gallilee had at last reached the object
      that she had in view.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      There was an interval of silence between the two ladies.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee waited for Miss Minerva to speak next. Miss Minerva waited
      to be taken into Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s confidence. The sparrows twittered in the
      garden; and, far away in the schoolroom, the notes of the piano announced
      that the music lesson had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The birds are noisy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the piano sounds out of tune,&rdquo; Miss Minerva remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it. Either Mrs. Gallilee must return to the matter
      in hand&mdash;-or the matter in hand must drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have not made myself understood,&rdquo; she resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have been very stupid,&rdquo; Miss Minerva confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resigning herself to circumstances, Mrs. Gallilee put the adjourned
      question under a new form. &ldquo;We were speaking of Mr. Le Frank as a teacher,
      and of my niece as a pupil,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have you been able to form any
      opinion of Carmina&rsquo;s musical abilities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva remained as prudent as ever. She answered, &ldquo;I have had no
      opportunity of forming an opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee met this cautious reply by playing her trump card. She
      handed a letter to Miss Minerva. &ldquo;I have received a proposal from Mr. Le
      Frank,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you tell me what you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter was short and servile. Mr. Le Frank presented his best
      respects. If Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s charming niece stood in need of musical
      instruction, he ventured to hope that he might have the honour and
      happiness of superintending her studies. Looking back to the top of the
      letter, the governess discovered that this modest request bore a date of
      eight days since. &ldquo;Have you written to Mr. Le Frank?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to say that I will take his request into consideration,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Gallilee replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she waited for her son&rsquo;s departure, before she committed herself to a
      decision? On the chance that this might be the case, Miss Minerva
      consulted her memory. When Mrs. Gallilee first decided on engaging a
      music-master to teach the children, her son had disapproved of employing
      Mr. Le Frank. This circumstance might possibly be worth bearing in mind.
      &ldquo;Do you see any objection to accepting Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s proposal?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Gallilee asked. Miss Minerva saw an objection forthwith, and, thanks to
      her effort of memory, discovered an especially mischievous way of stating
      it. &ldquo;I feel a certain delicacy in offering an opinion,&rdquo; she said modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee was surprised. &ldquo;Do you allude to Mr. Le Frank?&rdquo; she
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t doubt that his instructions would be of service to any young
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you thinking of my niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mrs. Gallilee. I am thinking of your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way, if you please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way. I believe your son would object to employing Mr. Le Frank as
      Miss Carmina&rsquo;s teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On musical grounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; on personal grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva explained her meaning. &ldquo;I think you have forgotten what
      happened, when you first employed Mr. Le Frank to teach Maria and Zoe. His
      personal appearance produced an unfavourable impression on your son; and
      Mr. Ovid made certain inquiries which you had not thought necessary.
      Pardon me if I persist in mentioning the circumstances. I owe it to myself
      to justify my opinion&mdash;an opinion, you will please to remember, that
      I did not volunteer. Mr. Ovid&rsquo;s investigations brought to light a very
      unpleasant report, relating to Mr. Le Frank and a young lady who had been
      one of his pupils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An abominable slander, Miss Minerva! I am surprised that you should refer
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am referring, madam, to the view of the matter taken by Mr. Ovid. If
      Mr. Le Frank had failed to defend himself successfully, he would of course
      not have been received into this house. But your son had his own opinion
      of the defence. I was present at the time, and I heard him say that, if
      Maria and Zoe had been older, he should have advised employing a
      music-master who had no false reports against him to contradict. As they
      were only children, he would say nothing more. That is what I had in my
      mind, when I gave my opinion. I think Mr. Ovid will be annoyed when he
      hears that Mr. Le Frank is his cousin&rsquo;s music-master. And, if any foolish
      gossip reaches him in his absence, I fear it might lead to mischievous
      results&mdash;I mean, to misunderstandings not easily set right by
      correspondence, and quite likely therefore to lead, in the end, to
      distrust and jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There she paused, and crossed her hands on her lap, and waited for what
      was to come next.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Gallilee could have looked into her mind at that moment as well as
      into her face, she would have read Miss Minerva&rsquo;s thoughts in these plain
      terms: &ldquo;All this time, madam, you have been keeping up appearances in the
      face of detection. You are going to use Mr. Le Frank as a means of making
      mischief between Ovid and Carmina. If you had taken me into your
      confidence, I might have been willing to help you. As it is, please
      observe that I am not caught in the trap you have set for me. If Mr. Ovid
      discovers your little plot, you can&rsquo;t lay the blame on your governess&rsquo;s
      advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee felt that she had again measured herself with Miss Minerva,
      and had again been beaten. She had confidently reckoned on the governess&rsquo;s
      secret feeling towards her son to encourage, without hesitation or
      distrust, any project for promoting the estrangement of Ovid and Carmina.
      There was no alternative now but to put her first obstacle in the way of
      the marriage, on her own sole responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that you have spoken sincerely,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you have
      failed to do justice to my son&rsquo;s good sense; and you are&mdash;naturally
      enough, in your position&mdash;incapable of estimating his devoted
      attachment to Carmina.&rdquo; Having planted that sting, she paused to observe
      the effect. Not the slightest visible result rewarded her. She went on.
      &ldquo;Almost the last words he said to me expressed his confidence&mdash;his
      affectionate confidence&mdash;in my niece. The bare idea of his being
      jealous of anybody, and especially of such a person as Mr. Le Frank, is
      simply ridiculous. I am astonished that you don&rsquo;t see it in that light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should see it in that light as plainly as you do,&rdquo; Miss Minerva quietly
      replied, &ldquo;if Mr. Ovid was at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does that make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;it makes a great difference, as I think. He has gone away
      on a long journey, and gone away in bad health. He will have his hours of
      depression. At such times, trifles are serious things; and even well-meant
      words&mdash;in letters&mdash;are sometimes misunderstood. I can offer no
      better apology for what I have said; and I can only regret that I have
      made so unsatisfactory a return for your flattering confidence in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having planted <i>her</i> sting, she rose to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any further commands for me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be quite sure that I have not misunderstood you,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;You consider Mr. Le Frank to be competent, as director of
      any young lady&rsquo;s musical studies? Thank you. On the one point on which I
      wished to consult you, my mind is at ease. Do you know where Carmina is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her room, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have the goodness to send her here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the greatest pleasure. Good-evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So ended Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s first attempt to make use of Miss Minerva,
      without trusting her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mistress of the house, and the governess of the house, had their own
      special reasons for retiring to their own rooms. Carmina was in solitude
      as a matter of necessity. The only friends that the poor girl could gather
      round her now, were the absent and the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had written to Ovid&mdash;merely for the pleasure of thinking that her
      letter would accompany him, in the mail-steamer which took him to Quebec.
      She had written to Teresa. She had opened her piano, and had played the
      divinely beautiful music of Mozart, until its tenderness saddened her, and
      she closed the instrument with an aching heart. For a while she sat by the
      window, thinking of Ovid. The decline of day has its melancholy affinities
      with the decline of life. As the evening wore on, her loneliness had
      become harder and harder to endure. She rang for the maid, and asked if
      Miss Minerva was at leisure. Miss Minerva had been sent for by Mrs.
      Gallilee. Where was Zo? In the schoolroom, waiting until Mr. Le Frank had
      done with Maria, to take her turn at the piano. Left alone again, Carmina
      opened her locket, and put Ovid&rsquo;s portrait by it on the table. Her sad
      fancy revived her dead parents&mdash;imagined her lover being presented to
      them&mdash;saw him winning their hearts by his genial voice, his sweet
      smile, his wise and kindly words. Miss Minerva, entering the room, found
      her still absorbed in her own little melancholy daydream; recalling the
      absent, reviving the dead&mdash;as if she had been nearing the close of
      life. And only seventeen years old. Alas for Carmina, only seventeen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started. &ldquo;Is there anything wrong?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What makes you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak in such a strange way. Oh, Frances, I have been longing for you
      to keep me company! And now you are here, you look at me as coldly as if I
      had offended you. Perhaps you are not well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I am not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have some of my lavender water! Let me bathe your forehead, and then blow
      on it to cool you this hot weather. No? Sit down, dear, at any rate. What
      does my aunt want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better not tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your aunt is sure to ask you what I have said. I have tried her temper;
      you know what her temper is! She has sent me here instead of sending a
      maid, on the chance that I may commit some imprudence. I give you her
      message exactly as the servant might have given it&mdash;and you can tell
      her so with a safe conscience. No more questions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more, please. Is it anything about Ovid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my aunt can wait a little. Do sit down! I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Ovid, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s look and tone at once set Miss Minerva&rsquo;s mind at ease. Her
      conduct, on the day of Ovid&rsquo;s departure, had aroused no jealous suspicion
      in her innocent rival. She refused to take the offered chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you your aunt is out of temper,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go to her
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina rose unwillingly. &ldquo;There were so many things I wanted to say to
      you,&rdquo; she began&mdash;and was interrupted by a rapid little series of
      knocks at the door. Was the person in a hurry? The person proved to be the
      discreet and accomplished Maria. She made her excuses to Carmina with
      sweetness, and turned to Miss Minerva with sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say that you are wanted in the schoolroom. Mr. Le Frank can
      do nothing with Zoe. Oh, dear!&rdquo; She sighed over her sister&rsquo;s wickedness,
      and waited for instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be called away, under any circumstances, was a relief to Miss Minerva.
      Carmina&rsquo;s affectionate welcome had irritated her in the most
      incomprehensible manner. She was angry with herself for being irritated;
      she felt inclined to abuse the girl for believing her. &ldquo;You fool, why
      don&rsquo;t you see through me? Why don&rsquo;t you write to that other fool who is in
      love with you, and tell him how I hate you both?&rdquo; But for her
      self-command, she might have burst out with such mad words as those.
      Maria&rsquo;s appearance was inexpressibly welcome. &ldquo;Say I will follow you
      directly,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria, in the language of the stage, made a capital exit. With a few
      hurried words of apology, Miss Minerva prepared to follow. Carmina stopped
      her at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard on Zo!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must do my duty,&rdquo; Miss Minerva answered sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were sometimes naughty ourselves when we were children,&rdquo; Carmina
      pleaded. &ldquo;And only the other day she had bread and water for tea. I am so
      fond of Zo! And besides&mdash;&rdquo; she looked doubtfully at Miss Minerva&mdash;&ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think Mr. Le Frank is the sort of man to get on with children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After what had just passed between Mrs. Gallilee and herself, this
      expression of opinion excited the governess&rsquo;s curiosity. &ldquo;What makes you
      say that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, for one thing Mr. Le Frank is so ugly. Don&rsquo;t you agree
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better keep your opinion to yourself. If he heard of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he vain? My poor father used to say that all bad musicians were vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call Mr. Le Frank a bad musician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I do! I heard him at his concert. Mere execution of the most
      mechanical kind. A musical box is as good as that man&rsquo;s playing. This is
      how he does it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her girlish good spirits had revived in her friend&rsquo;s company. She turned
      gaily to the piano, and amused herself by imitating Mr. Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another knock at the door&mdash;a single peremptory knock this time&mdash;stopped
      the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva had left the door ajar, when Carmina had prevented her from
      quitting the room. She looked through the open space, and discovered&mdash;Mr.
      Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bald head trembled, his florid complexion was livid with suppressed
      rage. &ldquo;That little devil has run away!&rdquo; he said&mdash;and hurried down the
      stairs again, as if he dare not trust himself to utter a word more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he heard me?&rdquo; Carmina asked in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may only have heard you playing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Offering this hopeful suggestion, Miss Minerva felt no doubt, in her own
      mind, that Mr. Le Frank was perfectly well acquainted with Carmina&rsquo;s
      opinion of him. It was easy enough to understand that he should himself
      inform the governess of an incident, so entirely beyond the reach of his
      own interference as the flight of Zo. But it was impossible to assume that
      the furious anger which his face betrayed, could have been excited by a
      child who had run away from a lesson. No: the vainest of men and musicians
      had heard that he was ugly, and that his pianoforte-playing resembled the
      performance of a musical box.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the room together&mdash;Carmina, ill at ease, to attend on her
      aunt; Miss Minerva, pondering on what had happened, to find the fugitive
      Zo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman had already spared her the trouble of searching the house. He
      had seen Zo running out bare-headed into the Square, and had immediately
      followed her. The young rebel was locked up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Zo; &ldquo;I
      hate Mr. Le Frank!&rdquo; Miss Minerva&rsquo;s mind was too seriously preoccupied to
      notice this aggravation of her pupil&rsquo;s offence. One subject absorbed her
      attention&mdash;the interview then in progress between Carmina and her
      aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s scheme prosper now? Mr. Le Frank might, or might
      not, consent to be Carmina&rsquo;s teacher. Another result, however, was
      certain. Miss Minerva thoroughly well knew the vindictive nature of the
      man. He neither forgave nor forgot&mdash;he was Carmina&rsquo;s enemy for life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The month of July was near its end.
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the morning of the twenty-eighth, Carmina was engaged in replying to a
      letter received from Teresa. Her answer contained a record of domestic
      events, during an interval of serious importance in her life under Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s roof. Translated from the Italian, the letter was expressed in
      these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you vexed with me, dearest, for this late reply to your sad news from
      Italy? I have but one excuse to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I hear of your anxiety about your husband, and not feel the wish to
      help you to bear your burden by writing cheerfully of myself? Over and
      over again, I have thought of you and have opened my desk. My spirits have
      failed me, and I have shut it up again. Am I now in a happier frame of
      mind? Yes, my good old nurse, I am happier. I have had a letter from Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has arrived safely at Quebec, and he is beginning to feel better
      already, after the voyage. You cannot imagine how beautifully, how
      tenderly he writes! I am almost reconciled to his absence, when I read his
      letter. Will that give you some idea of the happiness and the consolation
      that I owe to this best and dearest of men?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my old granny, I see you start, and make that favourite mark with
      your thumb-nail under the word &lsquo;consolation&rsquo;! I hear you say to yourself,
      &lsquo;Is she unhappy in her English home? And is Aunt Gallilee to blame for
      it?&rsquo; Yes! it is even so. What I would not for the whole world write to
      Ovid, I may confess to you. Aunt Gallilee is indeed a hard, hard woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember telling me, in your dear downright way, that Mr. Le Frank
      looked like a rogue? I don&rsquo;t know whether he is a rogue&mdash;but I do
      know that it is through his conduct that my aunt is offended with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened three weeks ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sent for me, and said that my education must be completed, and that
      my music in particular must be attended to. I was quite willing to obey
      her, and I said so with all needful readiness and respect. She answered
      that she had already chosen a music-master for me&mdash;and then, to my
      astonishment, she mentioned his name. Mr. Le Frank, who taught her
      children, was also to teach me! I have plenty of faults, but I really
      think vanity is not one of them. It is only due to my excellent master in
      Italy to say, that I am a better pianoforte player than Mr. Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never breathed a word of this, mind, to my aunt. It would have been
      ungrateful and useless. She knows and cares nothing about music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we parted good friends, and she wrote the same evening to engage my
      master. The next day she got his reply. Mr. Le Frank refused to be my
      professor of music&mdash;and this, after he had himself proposed to teach
      me, in a letter addressed to my aunt! Being asked for his reasons, he made
      an excuse. The spare time at his disposal, when he had written, had been
      since occupied by another pupil. The true reason for his conduct is, that
      he heard me speak of him&mdash;rashly enough, I don&rsquo;t deny it&mdash;as an
      ugly man and a bad player. Miss Minerva sounded him on the subject, at my
      request, for the purpose of course of making my apologies. He affected not
      to understand what she meant&mdash;with what motive I am sure I don&rsquo;t
      know. False and revengeful, you may say, and perhaps you may be right. But
      the serious part of it, so far as I am concerned, is my aunt&rsquo;s behaviour
      to me. If I had thwarted her in the dearest wish of her life, she could
      hardly treat me with greater coldness and severity. She has not stirred
      again, in the matter of my education. We only meet at meal-times; and she
      receives me, when I sit down at table, as she might receive a perfect
      stranger. Her icy civility is unendurable. And this woman is my darling
      Ovid&rsquo;s mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I done with my troubles now? No, Teresa; not even yet. Oh, how I
      wish I was with you in Italy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letters persist in telling me that I am deluded in believing Miss
      Minerva to be truly my friend. Do pray remember&mdash;even if I am wrong&mdash;what
      a solitary position mine is, in Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s house! I can play with
      dear little Zo; but whom can I talk to, whom can I confide in, if it turns
      out that Miss Minerva has been deceiving me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I wrote to you, I refused to acknowledge that any such dreadful
      discovery as this could be possible; I resented the bare idea of it as a
      cruel insult to my friend. Since that time&mdash;my face burns with shame
      while I write it&mdash;I am a little, just a little, shaken in my own
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you how it began? Yes; I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good old friend, you have your prejudices. But you speak your mind
      truly&mdash;and whom else can I consult? Not Ovid! The one effort of my
      life is to prevent him from feeling anxious about me. And, besides, I have
      contended against his opinion of Miss Minerva, and have brought him to
      think of her more kindly. Has he been right, notwithstanding? and are you
      right? And am I alone wrong? You shall judge for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva began to change towards me, after I had done the thing of
      all others which ought to have brought us closer together than ever. She
      is very poorly paid by my aunt, and she has been worried by little debts.
      When she owned this, I most willingly lent her the money to pay her bills&mdash;a
      mere trifle, only thirty pounds. What do you think she did? She crushed up
      the bank-notes in her hand, and left the room in the strangest headlong
      manner&mdash;as if I had insulted her instead of helping her! All the next
      day, she avoided me. The day after, I myself went to her room, and asked
      what was the matter. She gave me a most extraordinary answer. She said, &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know which of us two I most detest&mdash;myself or you. Myself for
      borrowing your money, or you for lending it.&rsquo; I left her; not feeling
      offended, only bewildered and distressed. More than an hour passed before
      she made her excuses. &lsquo;I am ill and miserable&rsquo;&mdash;that was all she
      said. She did indeed look so wretched that I forgave her directly. Would
      you not have done so too, in my place?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This happened a fortnight since. Only yesterday, she broke out again, and
      put my affection for her to a far more severe trial. I have not got over
      it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a message for her in Ovid&rsquo;s letter&mdash;expressed in the
      friendliest terms. He remembered with gratitude her kind promise, on
      saying good-bye; he believed she would do all that lay in her power to
      make my life happy in his absence; and he only regretted her leaving him
      in such haste that he had no time to thank her personally. Such was the
      substance of the message. I was proud and pleased to go to her room
      myself, and read it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you guess how she received me? Nobody&mdash;I say it positively&mdash;nobody
      could guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She actually flew into a rage! Not only with me (which I might have
      pardoned), but with Ovid (which is perfectly inexcusable). &lsquo;How dare he
      write to <i>you,&rsquo;</i> she burst out, &lsquo;of what I said to him when we took
      leave of each other? And how dare you come here, and read it to me? What
      do I care about your life, in his absence? Of what earthly consequence are
      his remembrance and his gratitude to Me!&rsquo; She spoke of him, with such fury
      and such contempt, that she roused me at last. I said to her, &lsquo;You
      abominable woman, there is but one excuse for you&mdash;you&rsquo;re mad!&rsquo; I
      left the room&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t I bang the door! We have not met since. Let
      me hear your opinion, Teresa. I was in a passion when I told her she was
      mad; but was I altogether wrong? Do you really think the poor creature is
      in her right senses?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking back at your letter, I see that you ask if I have made any new
      acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been introduced to one of the sweetest women I ever met with. And
      who do you think she is? My other aunt&mdash;Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s younger
      sister, Lady Northlake! They say she was not so handsome as Mrs. Gallilee,
      when they were both young. For my part, I can only declare that no such
      comparison is possible between them now. In look, in voice, in manner
      there is something so charming in Lady Northlake that I quite despair of
      describing it. My father used to say that she was amiable and weak; led by
      her husband, and easily imposed upon. I am not clever enough to have his
      eye for character: and perhaps I am weak and easily imposed upon too.
      Before I had been ten minutes in Lady Northlake&rsquo;s company, I would have
      given everything I possess in the world to have had <i>her</i> for my
      guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had called to say good-bye, on leaving London; and my aunt was not at
      home. We had a long delightful talk together. She asked me so kindly to
      visit her in Scotland, and be introduced to Lord Northlake, that I
      accepted the invitation with a glad heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my aunt returned, I quite forgot that we were on bad terms. I gave
      her an enthusiastic account of all that had passed between her sister and
      myself. How do you think she met this little advance on my part? She
      positively refused to let me go to Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I had in some degree got over my disappointment, I asked for
      her reasons. &lsquo;I am your guardian,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and I am acting in the
      exercise of my own discretion. I think it better you should stay with me.&rsquo; 
      I made no further remark. My aunt&rsquo;s cruelty made me think of my dead
      father&rsquo;s kindness. It was as much as I could do to keep from crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking over it afterwards, I supposed (as this is the season when
      everybody leaves town) that she had arranged to take me into the country
      with her. Mr. Gallilee, who is always good to me, thought so too, and
      promised me some sailing at the sea-side. To the astonishment of
      everybody, she has not shown any intention of going away from London! Even
      the servants ask what it means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a letter of complaints. Am I adding to your anxieties instead of
      relieving them? My kind old nurse, there is no need to be anxious. At the
      worst of my little troubles, I have only to think of Ovid&mdash;and his
      mother&rsquo;s ice melts away from me directly; I feel brave enough to endure
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my heart&rsquo;s best love, dear&mdash;no, next best love, after Ovid!&mdash;and
      give some of it to your poor suffering husband. May I ask one little
      favour? The English gentleman who has taken our old house at Rome, will
      not object to give you a few flowers out of what was once my garden. Send
      them to me in your next letter.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the twelfth of August, Carmina heard from Ovid again. He wrote from
      Montreal; describing the presentation of that letter of introduction which
      he had once been tempted to destroy. In the consequences that followed the
      presentation&mdash;apparently harmless consequences at the time&mdash;the
      destinies of Ovid, of Carmina, and of Benjulia proved to be seriously
      involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid&rsquo;s letter was thus expressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know, my love, if there is any other man in the world who is as
      fond of his darling as I am of you? If such a person exists, and if
      adverse circumstances compel him to travel, I should like to ask a
      question. Is he perpetually calling to mind forgotten things, which he
      ought to have said to his sweetheart before he left her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my case. Let me give you an instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made a new friend here&mdash;one Mr. Morphew. Last night, he was
      so kind as to invite me to a musical entertainment at his house. He is a
      medical man; and he amuses himself in his leisure hours by playing on that
      big and dreary member of the family of fiddles, whose name is Violoncello.
      Assisted by friends, he hospitably cools his guests, in the hot season, by
      the amateur performance of quartets. My dear, I passed a delightful
      evening. Listening to the music? Not listening to a single note of it.
      Thinking of You.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I roused your curiosity? I fancy I can see your eyes brighten; I
      fancy I can hear you telling me to go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My thoughts reminded me that music is one of the enjoyments of your life.
      Before I went away, I ought to have remembered this, and to have told you
      that the manager of the autumn concerts at the opera-house is an old
      friend of mine. He will be only too glad to place a box at your disposal,
      on any night when his programme attracts your notice; I have already made
      amends for my forgetfulness, by writing to him by this mail. Miss Minerva
      will be your companion at the theatre. If Mr. Le Frank (who is sure to be
      on the free list) pays you a visit in your box, tell him from me to put a
      wig on his bald head, and to try if <i>that</i> will make him look like an
      honest man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I forget anything else before my departure? Did I tell you how
      precious you are to me? how beautiful you are to me? how entirely
      worthless my life is without you? I dare say I did; but I tell it all over
      again&mdash;and, when you are tired of the repetition, you have only to
      let me know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meanwhile, have I nothing else to say? have I no travelling
      adventures to relate? You insist on hearing of everything that happens to
      me; and you are to have your own way before we are married, as well as
      after. My sweet Carmina, your willing slave has something more serious
      than common travelling adventures to relate&mdash;he has a confession to
      make. In plain words, I have been practising my profession again, in the
      city of Montreal!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether you will forgive me, when you are informed of the
      circumstances? It is a sad little story; but I am vain enough to think
      that my part in it will interest you. I have been a vain man, since that
      brightest and best of all possible days when you first made <i>your</i>
      confession&mdash;when you said that you loved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look back in my letter, and you will see Mr. Morphew mentioned as a new
      friend of mine, in Canada. I became acquainted with him through a letter
      of introduction, given to me by Benjulia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say nothing to anybody of what I am now going to tell you&mdash;and be
      especially careful, if you happen to see him, to keep Benjulia in the
      dark. I sincerely hope you will not see him. He is a hard-hearted man&mdash;and
      he might say something which would distress you, if he knew of the result
      which has followed his opening to me the door of his friend&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morphew is a worthy busy old gentleman, who follows his professional
      routine, and whose medical practice consists principally in bringing
      infant Canadians into the world. His services happened to be specially in
      request, at the time when I made his acquaintance. He was called away from
      his table, on the day after the musical party, when I dined with him. I
      was the only guest&mdash;and his wife was left to entertain me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good lady began by speaking of Benjulia. She roundly declared him to
      be a brute&mdash;and she produced my letter of introduction (closed by the
      doctor&rsquo;s own hand, before he gave it to me) as a proof. Would you like to
      read the letter, too? Here is a copy:&mdash;&lsquo;The man who brings this is an
      overworked surgeon, named Ovid Vere. He wants rest and good air. Don&rsquo;t
      encourage him to use his brains; and give him information enough to take
      him, by the shortest way, to the biggest desert in Canada.&rsquo; You will now
      understand that I am indebted to myself for the hospitable reception which
      has detained me at Montreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To return to my story. Mr. Morphew&rsquo;s services were again in request, ten
      minutes after he had left the house. This time the patient was a man&mdash;and
      the messenger declared that he was at the point of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Morphew seemed to be at a loss what to do. &lsquo;In this dreadful case,&rsquo; 
      she said, &lsquo;death is a mercy. What I cannot bear to think of is the poor
      man&rsquo;s lonely position. In his last moments, there will not be a living
      creature at his bedside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearing this, I ventured to make some inquiries. The answers painted such
      a melancholy picture of poverty and suffering, and so vividly reminded me
      of a similar case in my own experience, that I forgot I was an invalid
      myself, and volunteered to visit the dying man in Mr. Morphew&rsquo;s place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The messenger led me to the poorest quarter of the city and to a garret
      in one of the wretchedest houses in the street. There he lay, without
      anyone to nurse him, on a mattress on the floor. What his malady was, you
      will not ask to know. I will only say that any man but a doctor would have
      run out of the room, the moment he entered it. To save the poor creature
      was impossible. For a few days longer, I could keep pain in subjection,
      and could make death easy when it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my next visit he was able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I discovered that he was a member of my own profession&mdash;a mulatto
      from the Southern States of America, by birth. The one fatal event of his
      life had been his marriage. Every worst offence of which a bad woman can
      be guilty, his vile wife had committed&mdash;and his infatuated love clung
      to her through it all. She had disgraced and ruined him. Not once, but
      again and again he had forgiven her, under circumstances which degraded
      him in his own estimation, and in the estimation of his best friends. On
      the last occasion when she left him, he had followed her to Montreal. In a
      fit of drunken frenzy, she had freed him from her at last by
      self-destruction. Her death affected his reason. When he was discharged
      from the asylum, he spent his last miserable savings in placing a monument
      over her grave. As long as his strength held out, he made daily
      pilgrimages to the cemetery. And now, when the shadow of death was
      darkening over him, his one motive for clinging to life, his one reason
      for vainly entreating me to cure him, still centred in devotion to the
      memory of his wife. &lsquo;Nobody will take care of her grave,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when I
      am gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love, I have always thought fondly of you. After hearing this
      miserable story, my heart overflowed with gratitude to God for giving me
      Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died yesterday. His last words implored me to have him buried in the
      same grave with the woman who had dishonoured him. Who am I that I should
      judge him? Besides, I shall fulfil his last wishes as a thank-offering for
      You.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is still something more to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the day before his death he asked me to open an old portmanteau&mdash;literally,
      the one thing that he possessed. He had no money left, and no clothes. In
      a corner of the portmanteau there was a roll of papers, tied with a piece
      of string&mdash;and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make you but one return,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I give you my book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was too weak to tell me what the book was about, or to express any
      wish relative to its publication. I am ashamed to say I set no sort of
      value on the manuscript presented to me&mdash;except as a memorial of a
      sad incident in my life. Waking earlier than usual this morning, I opened
      and examined my gift for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my amazement, I found myself rewarded a hundredfold for the little
      that I had been able to do. This unhappy man must have been possessed of
      abilities which (under favouring circumstances) would, I don&rsquo;t hesitate to
      say, have ranked him among the greatest physicians of our time. The
      language in which he writes is obscure, and sometimes grammatically
      incorrect. But he, and he alone, has solved a problem in the treatment of
      disease, which has thus far been the despair of medical men throughout the
      whole civilised world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a stranger was looking over my shoulder, he would be inclined to say,
      This curious lover writes to his young lady as if she was a medical
      colleague! We understand each other, Carmina, don&rsquo;t we? My future career
      is an object of interest to my future wife. This poor fellow&rsquo;s gratitude
      has opened new prospects to me; and who will be so glad to hear of it as
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I close my letter, you will expect me to say a word more about my
      health. Sometimes I feel well enough to take my cabin in the next vessel
      that sails for Liverpool. But there are other occasions, particularly when
      I happen to over-exert myself in walking or riding, which warn me to be
      careful and patient. My next journey will take me inland, to the mighty
      plains and forest of this grand country. When I have breathed the
      health-giving air of those regions, I shall be able to write definitely of
      the blessed future day which is to unite us once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother has, I suppose, given her usual conversazione at the end of the
      season. Let me hear how you like the scientific people at close quarters,
      and let me give you a useful hint. When you meet in society with a
      particularly positive man, who looks as if he was sitting for his
      photograph, you may safely set that man down as a Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously, I do hope that you and my mother get on well together. You say
      too little of each other in your letters to me, and I am sometimes
      troubled by misgivings. There is another odd circumstance, connected with
      our correspondence, which sets me wondering. I always send messages to
      Miss Minerva; and Miss Minerva never sends any messages back to me. Do you
      forget? or am I an object of perfect indifference to your friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My latest news of you all is from Zo. She has sent me a letter, in one of
      the envelopes that I directed for her when I went away. Miss Minerva&rsquo;s
      hair would stand on end if she could see the blots and the spelling. Zo&rsquo;s
      account of the family circle (turned into intelligible English), will I
      think personally interest you. Here it is, in its own Roman brevity&mdash;with
      your pretty name shortened to two syllables: &lsquo;Except Pa and Car, we are a
      bad lot at home.&rsquo; After that, I can add nothing that is worth reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the kisses, my angel, that I leave for you on the blank morsel of
      paper below, and love me as I love you. There is a world of meaning,
      Carmina, even in those commonplace words. Oh, if I could only go to you by
      the mail steamer, in the place of my letter!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The answers to Ovid&rsquo;s questions were not to be found in Carmina&rsquo;s reply.
      She had reasons for not mentioning the conversazione; and she shrank from
      writing to him of his mother. Her true position in Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s house&mdash;growing,
      day by day, harder and harder to endure; threatening, more and more
      plainly, complications and perils to come&mdash;was revealed in her next
      letter to her old friend in Italy. She wrote to Teresa in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you love me, forget the inhuman manner in which I have spoken of Miss
      Minerva!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After I had written to you, I would have recalled my letter, if it could
      have been done. I began, that evening, to feel ashamed of what I had said
      in my anger. As the hours went on, and bedtime approached, I became so
      wretched that I ran the risk of another harsh reception, by intruding on
      her once more. It was a circumstance in my favour that she was, to all
      appearance, in bad spirits too. There was something in her voice, when she
      asked what I wanted, which made me think&mdash;though she looks like the
      last person in the world to be guilty of such weakness&mdash;that she had
      been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave the best expression I could to my feelings of repentance and
      regret. What I actually said to her, has slipped out of my memory; I was
      frightened and upset&mdash;and I am always stupid in that condition. My
      attempt at reconciliation may have been clumsy enough; but she might
      surely have seen that I had no intention to mystify and distress her. And
      yet, what else could she have imagined?&mdash;to judge by her own actions
      and words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her bedroom candle was on the table behind me. She snatched it up and
      held it before my face, and looked at me as if I was some extraordinary
      object that she had never seen or heard of before! &lsquo;You are little better
      than a child,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I have ten times your strength of will&mdash;what
      is there in you that I can&rsquo;t resist? Go away from me! Be on your guard
      against me! I am false; I am suspicious; I am cruel. You simpleton, have
      you no instincts to protect you? Is there nothing in you that shrinks from
      me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She put down the candle, and burst into a wretched mocking laugh. &lsquo;There
      she stands,&rsquo; cried this strange creature, &lsquo;and looks at me with the eyes
      of a baby that sees something new! I can&rsquo;t frighten her. I can&rsquo;t disgust
      her. What does it mean?&rsquo; She dropped into a chair; her voice sank almost
      to a whisper&mdash;I should have thought she was afraid of me, if such a
      thing had been possible. &lsquo;What do you know of me, that I don&rsquo;t know of
      myself?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was quite beyond me to understand what she meant. I took a chair, and
      sat down by her. &lsquo;I only know what you said to me yesterday,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What did I say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You told me you were miserable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I told you a lie! Believe what I have said to you to-day. In your own
      interests, believe it to be the truth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing would induce me to believe it. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You were miserable
      yesterday, and you are miserable to-day. <i>That</i> is the truth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What put my next bold words into my head, I don&rsquo;t know. It doesn&rsquo;t
      matter; the thought was in me&mdash;and out it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I think you have some burden on your mind,&rsquo; I went on. &lsquo;If I can&rsquo;t
      relieve you of it, perhaps I can help you bear it. Come! tell me what it
      is.&rsquo; I waited; but it was of no use&mdash;she never even looked at me.
      Because I am in love myself, do I think everybody else is like me? I
      thought she blushed. I don&rsquo;t know what else I thought. &lsquo;Are you in love?&rsquo; 
      I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She jumped up from her chair, so suddenly and so violently that she threw
      it on the floor. Still, not a word passed her lips. I found courage enough
      to go on&mdash;but not courage enough to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I love Ovid, and Ovid loves me,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;There is my consolation,
      whatever my troubles may be. Are you not so fortunate?&rsquo; A dreadful
      expression of pain passed over her face. How could I see it, and not feel
      the wish to sympathise with her? I ran the risk, and said, &lsquo;Do you love
      somebody, who doesn&rsquo;t love you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She turned her back on me, and went to the toilet-table. I think she
      looked at herself in the glass. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, speaking to me at last,
      &lsquo;what else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing else,&rsquo; I answered&mdash;&lsquo;except that I hope I have not offended
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She left the glass as suddenly as she had approached it, and took up the
      candle again. Once more she held it so that it lit my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Guess who he is,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How can I do that?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She quietly put down the candle again. In some way, quite
      incomprehensible to myself, I seemed to have relieved her. She spoke to me
      in a changed voice, gently and sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the best of good girls, and you mean kindly. It&rsquo;s of no use&mdash;you
      can do nothing. Forgive my insolence yesterday; I was mad with envy of
      your happy marriage engagement. You don&rsquo;t understand such a nature as
      mine. So much the better! ah, so much the better! Good-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was such hopeless submission, such patient suffering, in those
      words, that I could not find it in my heart to leave her. I thought of how
      I might have behaved, of the wild things I might have said, if Ovid had
      cared nothing for me. Had some cruel man forsaken her? That was <i>her</i>
      secret. I asked myself what I could do to encourage her. Your last letter,
      with our old priest&rsquo;s enclosure, was in my pocket. I took it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Would you mind reading a short letter,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;before we wish each
      other goodnight?&rsquo; I held out the priest&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She drew back with a dark look; she appeared to have some suspicion of
      it. &lsquo;Who is the writer?&rsquo; she inquired sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A person who is a stranger to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her face cleared directly. She took the letter from me, and waited to
      hear what I had to say next. &lsquo;The person,&rsquo; I told her, &lsquo;is a wise and good
      old man&mdash;the priest who married my father and mother, and baptised
      me. We all of us used to consult Father Patrizio, when we wanted advice.
      My nurse Teresa felt anxious about me in Ovid&rsquo;s absence; she spoke to him
      about my marriage engagement, and of my exile&mdash;forgive me for using
      the word!&mdash;in this house. He said he would consider, before he gave
      her his opinion. The next day, he sent her the letter which you have got
      in your hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I came to a full stop; having something yet to say, but not
      knowing how to express myself with the necessary delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you wish me to read the letter?&rsquo; she asked, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is something in it which might&mdash;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, like a fool, I came to another full stop. She was as patient as
      ever; she only made a little sign to me to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I think Father Patrizio&rsquo;s letter might put you in a better frame of
      mind,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;it might keep you from despising yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went back to her chair, and read the letter. You have permitted me to
      keep the comforting words of the good Father, among my other treasures. I
      copy his letter for you in this place&mdash;so that you may read it again,
      and see what I had in my mind, and understand how it affected poor Miss
      Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Teresa, my well-beloved friend,&mdash;I have considered the anxieties
      that trouble you, with this result: that I can do my best,
      conscientiously, to quiet your mind. I have had the experience of forty
      years in the duties of the priesthood. In that long time, the innermost
      secrets of thousands of men and women have been confided to me. From such
      means of observation, I have drawn many useful conclusions; and some of
      them may be also useful to you. I will put what I have to say, in the
      plainest and fewest words: consider them carefully, on your side. The
      growth of the better nature, in women, is perfected by one influence&mdash;and
      that influence is Love. Are you surprised that a priest should write in
      this way? Did you expect me to say, Religion? Love, my sister, <i>is</i>
      Religion, in women. It opens their hearts to all that is good for them;
      and it acts independently of the conditions of human happiness. A
      miserable woman, tormented by hopeless love, is still the better and the
      nobler for that love; and a time will surely come when she will show it.
      You have fears for Carmina&mdash;cast away, poor soul, among strangers
      with hard hearts! I tell you to have no fears. She may suffer under
      trials; she may sink under trials. But the strength to rise again is in
      her&mdash;and that strength is Love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having read our old friend&rsquo;s letter, Miss Minerva turned back, and read
      it again&mdash;and waited a little, repeating some part of it to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Does it encourage you?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She handed the letter back to me. &lsquo;I have got one sentence in it by
      heart,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know what that sentence is, without my telling you. I felt so
      relieved, when I saw the change in her for the better&mdash;I was so
      inexpressibly happy in the conviction that we were as good friends again
      as ever&mdash;that I bent down to kiss her, on saying goodnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She put up her hand and stopped me. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;not till I have done
      something to deserve it. You are more in need of help than you think. Stay
      here a little longer; I have a word to say to you about your aunt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I returned to my chair, feeling a little startled. Her eyes rested on me
      absently&mdash;she was, as I imagined, considering with herself, before
      she spoke. I refrained from interrupting her thoughts. The night was still
      and dark. Not a sound reached our ears from without. In the house, the
      silence was softly broken by a rustling movement on the stairs. It came
      nearer. The door was opened suddenly. Mrs. Gallilee entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What folly possessed me? Why was I frightened? I really could not help it&mdash;I
      screamed. My aunt walked straight up to me, without taking the smallest
      notice of Miss Minerva. &lsquo;What are you doing here, when you ought to be in
      your bed?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She spoke in such an imperative manner&mdash;with such authority and such
      contempt&mdash;that I looked at her in astonishment. Some suspicion seemed
      to be roused in her by finding me and Miss Minerva together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more gossip!&rsquo; she called out sternly. &lsquo;Do you hear me? Go to bed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not enough to rouse anybody? I felt my pride burning in my face.
      &lsquo;Am I a child, or a servant?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I shall go to bed early or late as
      I please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She took one step forward; she seized me by the arm, and forced me to my
      feet. Think of it, Teresa! In all my life I have never had a hand laid on
      me except in kindness. Who knows it better than you! I tried vainly to
      speak&mdash;I saw Miss Minerva rise to interfere&mdash;I heard her say,
      &lsquo;Mrs. Gallilee, you forget yourself!&rsquo; Somehow, I got out of the room. On
      the landing, a dreadful fit of trembling shook me from head to foot. I
      sank down on the stairs. At first, I thought I was going to faint. No; I
      shook and shivered, but I kept my senses. I could hear their voices in the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee began. &lsquo;Did you tell me just now that I had forgotten
      myself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva answered, &lsquo;Certainly, madam. You <i>did</i> forget
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next words escaped me. After that, they grew louder; and I heard them
      again&mdash;my aunt first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am dissatisfied with your manner to me, Miss Minerva. It has latterly
      altered very much for the worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In what respect, Mrs. Gallilee?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In this respect. Your way of speaking to me implies an assertion of
      equality&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Stop a minute, madam! I am not so rich as you are. But I am at a loss to
      know in what other way I am not your equal. Did you assert your
      superiority&mdash;may I ask&mdash;when you came into my room without first
      knocking at the door?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Minerva! Do you wish to remain in my service?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Say employment, Mrs. Gallilee&mdash;if you please. I am quite
      indifferent in the matter. I am equally ready, at your entire convenience,
      to stay or to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s voice sounded nearer, as if she was approaching the door.
      &lsquo;I think we arranged,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that there was to be a month&rsquo;s notice on
      either side, when I first engaged you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;at my suggestion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Take your month&rsquo;s notice, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dating from to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt came out, and found me on the stairs. I tried to rise. It was not
      to be done. My head turned giddy. She must have seen that I was quite
      prostrate&mdash;and yet she took no notice of the state I was in. Cruel,
      cruel creature! she accused me of listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that the poor girl is ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Miss Minerva&rsquo;s voice. I looked round at her, feeling fainter and
      fainter. She stooped; I felt her strong sinewy arms round me; she lifted
      me gently. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you,&rsquo; she whispered&mdash;and carried me
      downstairs to my room, as easily as if I had been a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must rest, Teresa. The remembrance of that dreadful night brings it all
      back again. Don&rsquo;t be anxious about me, my old dear! You shall hear more
      to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the next day events happened, the influence of which upon Carmina&rsquo;s
      excitable nature urged her to complete her unfinished letter, without
      taking the rest that she needed. Once more&mdash;and, as the result
      proved, for the last time&mdash;she wrote to her faithful old friend in
      these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to tell you how the night passed! Miss Minerva was the first
      person who came to me in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had barely said a few kind words, when Maria interrupted us,
      reminding her governess of the morning&rsquo;s lessons. &lsquo;Mrs. Gallilee has sent
      her,&rsquo; Miss Minerva whispered; &lsquo;I will return to you in the hour before the
      children&rsquo;s dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next person who appeared was, as we had both anticipated, Mrs.
      Gallilee herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She brought me a cup of tea; and the first words she spoke were words of
      apology for her conduct on the previous night. Her excuse was that she had
      been &lsquo;harassed by anxieties which completely upset her.&rsquo; And&mdash;can you
      believe it?&mdash;she implored me not to mention &lsquo;the little
      misunderstanding between us when I next wrote to her son!&rsquo; Is this woman
      made of iron and stone, instead of flesh and blood? Does she really think
      me such a wretch as to cause Ovid, under any provocation, a moment&rsquo;s
      anxiety while he is away? The fewest words that would satisfy her, and so
      send her out of my room, were the only words I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this, an agreeable surprise was in store for me. The familiar voice
      of good Mr. Gallilee applied for admission&mdash;through the keyhole!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are you asleep, my dear? May I come in?&rsquo; His kind, fat old face peeped
      round the door when I said Yes&mdash;and reminded me of Zo, at dinner,
      when she asks for more pudding, and doesn&rsquo;t think she will get it. Mr.
      Gallilee had something to ask for, and some doubt of getting it, which
      accounted for the resemblance. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve taken the liberty, Carmina, of
      sending for our doctor. You&rsquo;re a delicate plant, my dear&mdash;&rsquo; (Here,
      his face disappeared and he spoke to somebody outside)&mdash;&lsquo;You think so
      yourself, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Null? And you have a family of daughters, haven&rsquo;t
      you?&rsquo; (His face appeared again; more like Zo than ever.) &lsquo;Do please see
      him, my child; I&rsquo;m not easy about you. I was on the stairs last night&mdash;nobody
      ever notices me, do they, Mr. Null?&mdash;and I saw Miss Minerva&mdash;good
      creature, and, Lord, how strong!&mdash;carrying you to your bed. Mr.
      Null&rsquo;s waiting outside. Don&rsquo;t distress me by saying No!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anybody cruel enough to distress Mr. Gallilee? The doctor came
      in&mdash;looking like a clergyman; dressed all in black, with a beautiful
      frill to his shirt, and a spotless white cravat. He stared hard at me; he
      produced a little glass-tube; he gave it a shake, and put it under my arm;
      he took it away again, and consulted it; he said, &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; he approved of my
      tongue; he disliked my pulse; he gave his opinion at last. &lsquo;Perfect quiet.
      I must see Mrs. Gallilee.&rsquo; And there was an end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gallilee observed the medical proceedings with awe. &lsquo;Mr. Null is a
      wonderful man,&rsquo; he whispered, before he followed the doctor out. Ill and
      wretched as I was, this little interruption amused me. I wonder why I
      write about it here? There are serious things waiting to be told&mdash;am
      I weakly putting them off?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva came back to me as she had promised. &lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; she said
      gravely, &lsquo;that the doctor has been to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked if the doctor thought me very ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks you have narrowly escaped a nervous fever; and he has given
      some positive orders. One of them is that your slightest wishes are to be
      humoured. If he had not said that, Mrs. Gallilee would have prevented me
      from seeing you. She has been obliged to give way; and she hates me&mdash;almost
      as bitterly, Carmina, as she hates you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This called to my mind the interruption of the previous night, when Miss
      Minerva had something important to tell me. When I asked what it was, she
      shook her head, and said painful subjects of conversation were not fit
      subjects in my present state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need I add that I insisted on hearing what she had to say? Oh, how
      completely my poor father must have been deceived, when he made his
      horrible sister my guardian! If I had not fortunately offended the
      music-master, she would have used Mr. Le Frank as a means of making Ovid
      jealous, and of sowing the seeds of dissension between us. Having failed
      so far, she is (as Miss Minerva thinks) at a loss to discover any other
      means of gaining her wicked ends. Her rage at finding herself baffled
      seems to account for her furious conduct, when she discovered me in Miss
      Minerva&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will ask, as I did, what has she to gain by this wicked plotting and
      contriving, with its shocking accompaniments of malice and anger?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva answered, &lsquo;I still believe that money is the motive. Her son
      is mistaken about her; her friends are mistaken; they think she is fond of
      money&mdash;the truer conclusion is, she is short of money. There is the
      secret of the hard bargains she drives, and the mercenary opinions she
      holds. I don&rsquo;t doubt that her income would be enough for most other women
      in her position. It is not enough for a woman who is jealous of her rich
      sister&rsquo;s place in the world. Wait a little, and you will see that I am not
      talking at random. You were present at the grand party she gave some
      week&rsquo;s since?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I wish I had stayed in my own room,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Mrs. Gallilee was offended
      with me for not admiring her scientific friends. With one or two
      exceptions, they talked of nothing but themselves and their discoveries&mdash;and,
      oh, dear, how ugly they were!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind that now, Carmina. Did you notice the profusion of splendid
      flowers, in the hall and on the staircase, as well as in the
      reception-rooms?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Did you observe&mdash;no, you are a young girl&mdash;did you hear any of
      the gentlemen, in the supper-room, expressing their admiration of the
      luxuries provided for the guests, the exquisite French cookery and the
      delicious wine? Why was all the money which these things cost spent in one
      evening? Because Lady Northlake&rsquo;s parties must be matched by Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s parties. Lady Northlake lives in a fashionable neighbourhood in
      London, and has splendid carriages and horses. This is a fashionable
      neighbourhood. Judge what this house costs, and the carriages and horses,
      when I tell you that the rent of the stables alone is over a hundred
      pounds a year. Lady Northlake has a superb place in Scotland. Mrs.
      Gallilee is not able to rival her sister in that respect&mdash;but she has
      her marine villa in the Isle of Wight. When Mr. Gallilee said you should
      have some sailing this autumn, did you think he meant that he would hire a
      boat? He referred to the yacht, which is part of the establishment at the
      sea-side. Lady Northlake goes yachting with her husband; and Mrs. Gallilee
      goes yachting with her husband. Do you know what it costs, when the first
      milliner in Paris supplies English ladies with dresses? That milliner&rsquo;s
      lowest charge for a dress which Mrs. Gallilee would despise&mdash;ordinary
      material, my dear, and imitation lace&mdash;is forty pounds. Think a
      little&mdash;and even your inexperience will see that the mistress of this
      house is spending more than she can afford, and is likely (unless she has
      resources that we know nothing about) to be, sooner or later, in serious
      need of money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was a new revelation to me, and it altered my opinion of course. But
      I still failed to see what Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s extravagances had to do with
      her wicked resolution to prevent Ovid from marrying me. Miss Minerva&rsquo;s
      only answer to this was to tell me to write to Mr. Mool, while I had the
      chance, and ask for a copy of my father&rsquo;s Will. &lsquo;I will take the letter to
      him,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and bring the reply myself. It will save time, if it does
      nothing else.&rsquo; The letter was written in a minute. Just as she took it
      from me, the parlour-maid announced that the early dinner was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hours later, the reply was in my hands. The old father had taken
      Maria and Zo for their walk; and Miss Minerva had left the house by
      herself&mdash;sending word to Mrs. Gallilee that she was obliged to go out
      on business of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Did Mrs. Gallilee see you come in?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes. She was watching for me, no doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she see you go upstairs to my room?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And said nothing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We looked at each other; both of us feeling the same doubt of how the day
      would end. Miss Minerva pointed impatiently to the lawyer&rsquo;s reply. I
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mool&rsquo;s letter was very kind, but quite incomprehensible in the latter
      part of it. After referring me to his private residence, in case I wished
      to consult him personally later in the day, he mentioned some proceeding,
      called &lsquo;proving the Will,&rsquo; and some strange place called &lsquo;Doctors&rsquo; 
      Commons.&rsquo; However, there was the copy of the Will, and that was all we
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began reading it. How I pitied the unfortunate men who have to learn
      the law! My dear Teresa, I might as well have tried to read an unknown
      tongue. The strange words, the perpetual repetitions, the absence of
      stops, utterly bewildered me. I handed the copy to Miss Minerva. Instead
      of beginning on the first page, as I had done, she turned to the last.
      With what breathless interest I watched her face! First, I saw that she
      understood what she was reading. Then, after a while, she turned pale. And
      then, she lifted her eyes to me. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was frightened. My ignorant imagination pictured some dreadful
      unknown power given to Mrs. Gallilee by the Will. &lsquo;What can my aunt do to
      me?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva composed me&mdash;without concealing the truth. &lsquo;In her
      position, Carmina, and with her intensely cold and selfish nature, there
      is no fear of her attempting to reach her ends by violent means. Your
      happiness may be in danger&mdash;and that prospect, God knows, is bad
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she talked of my happiness, I naturally thought of Ovid. I asked if
      there was anything about him in the Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no doubt a stupid thing to say at such a time; and it seemed to
      annoy her. &lsquo;You are the only person concerned,&rsquo; she answered sharply. &lsquo;It
      is Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s interest that you shall never be her son&rsquo;s wife, or any
      man&rsquo;s wife. If she can have her way, you will live and die an unmarried
      woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This did me good: it made me angry. I began to feel like myself again. I
      said, &lsquo;Please let me hear the rest of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva first patiently explained to me what she had read in the
      Will. She then returned to the subject of my aunt&rsquo;s extravagance; speaking
      from experience of what had happened in her own family. &lsquo;If Mrs. Gallilee
      borrows money,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;her husband will, in all probability, have to
      repay the loan. And, if borrowings go on in that way, Maria and Zoe will
      be left wretchedly provided for, in comparison with Lady Northlake&rsquo;s
      daughters. A fine large fortune would wonderfully improve these doubtful
      prospects&mdash;can you guess, Carmina, where it is to come from?&rsquo; I could
      easily guess, now I understood the Will. My good Teresa, if I die without
      leaving children, the fine large fortune comes from Me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it all now&mdash;don&rsquo;t you? After I had thanked Miss Minerva,
      turned away my head on the pillow overpowered by disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clock in the hall struck the hour of the children&rsquo;s tea. Miss Minerva
      would be wanted immediately. At parting, she kissed me. &lsquo;There is the kiss
      that you meant to give me last night,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t despair of
      yourself. I am to be in the house for a month longer; and I am a match for
      Mrs. Gallilee. We will say no more now. Compose yourself, and try to
      sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went away to her duties. Sleep was out of the question. My attention
      wandered when I tried to read. Doing nothing meant, in other words,
      thinking of what had happened. If you had come into my room, I should have
      told you all about it. The next best thing was to talk to you in this way.
      You don&rsquo;t know what a relief it has been to me to write these lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night has come, and Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s cruelty has at last proved too
      much even for my endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try not to be surprised; try not to be alarmed. If my mind to-morrow is
      the same as my mind to-night, I shall attempt to make my escape. I shall
      take refuge with Lady Northlake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if I could go to Ovid! But he is travelling in the deserts of Canada.
      Until his return to the coast, I can only write to him to the care of his
      bankers at Quebec. I should not know where to find him, when I arrived;
      and what a dreadful meeting&mdash;if I did find him&mdash;to be obliged to
      acknowledge that it is his mother who has driven me away! There will be
      nothing to alarm him, if I go to his mother&rsquo;s sister. If you could see
      Lady Northlake, you would feel as sure as I do that she will take my part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After writing to you, I must have fallen asleep. It was quite dark, when
      I was awakened by the striking of a match in my room. I looked round,
      expecting to see Miss Minerva. The person lighting my candle was Mrs.
      Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She poured out the composing medicine which Mr. Null had ordered for me.
      I took it in silence. She sat down by the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My child,&rsquo; she began, &lsquo;we are friends again now. You bear no malice, I
      am sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distrust still kept me silent. I remembered that she had watched for Miss
      Minerva&rsquo;s return, and that she had seen Miss Minerva go up to my room. The
      idea that she meant to be revenged on us both for having our secrets, and
      keeping them from her knowledge, took complete possession of my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are you feeling better?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is there anything I can get for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not now&mdash;thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Would you like to see Mr. Null again, before to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These were ungraciously short replies&mdash;but it cost me an effort to
      speak to her at all. She showed no signs of taking offence; she proceeded
      as smoothly as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Carmina, I have my faults of temper; and, with such pursuits as
      mine, I am not perhaps a sympathetic companion for a young girl. But I
      hope you believe that it is my duty and my pleasure to be a second mother
      to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she did really say that! Whether I was only angry, or whether I was
      getting hysterical, I don&rsquo;t know. I began to feel an oppression in my
      breathing that almost choked me. There are two windows in my room, and one
      of them only was open. I was obliged to ask her to open the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did it; she came back, and fanned me. I submitted as long as I could&mdash;and
      then I begged her not to trouble herself any longer. She put down the fan,
      and went on with what she had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I wish to speak to you about Miss Minerva. You are aware that I gave her
      notice, last night, to leave her situation. For your sake, I regret that I
      did not take this step before you came to England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My confidence in myself returned when I heard Miss Minerva spoken of in
      this way. I said at once that I considered her to be one of my best and
      truest friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My dear child, that is exactly what I lament! This person has insinuated
      herself into your confidence&mdash;and she is utterly unworthy of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I let those abominable words pass in silence? &lsquo;Mrs. Gallilee!&rsquo; I
      said, &lsquo;you are cruelly wronging a woman whom I love and respect!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Gallilee?&rsquo; she repeated. &lsquo;Do I owe it to Miss Minerva that you have
      left off calling me Aunt? Your obstinacy, Carmina, leaves me no
      alternative but to speak out. If I had done my duty, I ought to have said
      long since, what I am going to say now. You are putting your trust in the
      bitterest enemy you have; an enemy who secretly hates you with the
      unforgiving hatred of a rival!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look back at my letter, describing what passed between Miss Minerva and
      me, when I went to her room; and you will know what I felt on hearing her
      spoken of as &lsquo;a rival.&rsquo; My sense of justice refused to believe it. But,
      oh, my dear old nurse, there was some deeper sense in me that said, as if
      in words, It is true!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee went on, without mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know her thoroughly; I have looked into her false heart. Nobody has
      discovered her but me. Charge her with it, if you like; and let her deny
      it if she dare. Miss Minerva is secretly in love with my son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She got up. Her object was gained: she was even with me, and with the
      woman who had befriended me, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Lie down in your bed again,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and think over what I have told
      you. In your own interests, think over it well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what saved me from sinking under the shock? Ovid&mdash;thousands
      and thousands of miles away&mdash;Ovid saved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him with all my heart and soul; and I do firmly believe that I
      know him better than I know myself. If his mother had betrayed Miss
      Minerva to him, as she has betrayed her to me, that unhappy woman would
      have had his truest pity. I am as certain of this, as I am that I see the
      moon, while I write, shining on my bed. Ovid would have pitied her. And I
      pitied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote the lines that follow, and sent them to her by the maid. In the
      fear that she might mistake my motives, and think me angry and jealous, I
      addressed her with my former familiarity by her christian name:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Last
      night, Frances, I ventured to ask if you loved some one who did not love
      you. And you answered by saying to me, Guess who he is. My aunt has just
      told me that he is her son. Has she spoken the truth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am now waiting to receive Miss Minerva&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the first time since I have been in the house, my door is locked. I
      cannot, and will not, see Mrs. Gallilee again. All her former cruelties
      are, as I feel it, nothing to the cruelty of her coming here when I am
      ill, and saying to me what she has said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weary time passes, and still there is no reply. Is Frances angry? or
      is she hesitating how to answer me&mdash;personally or by writing? No! she
      has too much delicacy of feeling to answer in her own person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only done her justice. The maid has just asked me to open the
      door. I have got my answer. Read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Gallilee has spoken the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How I can have betrayed myself so that she has discovered my miserable
      secret is more than I can tell I will not own it to her or to any living
      creature but yourself. Undeserving as I am, I know that I can trust you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is needless to dwell at any length on this confession. Many things in
      my conduct, which must have perplexed you, will explain themselves flow.
      There has been, however, one concealment on my part, which it is due to
      you that I should acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If Mrs. Gallilee had taken me into her confidence, I confess that my
      jealousy would have degraded me into becoming her accomplice. As things
      were, I was too angry and too cunning to let her make use of me without
      trusting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There are other acts of deceit which I ought to acknowledge&mdash;if I
      could summon composure enough to write about them. Better to say at once&mdash;I
      am not worthy of your pardon, not worthy even of your pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;With the same sincerity, I warn you that the wickedness in me, on which
      Mrs. Gallilee calculated, may be in me still. The influence of your higher
      and better nature&mdash;helped perhaps by that other influence of which
      the old priest spoke in his letter&mdash;has opened my heart to tenderness
      and penitence of which I never believed myself capable: has brought the
      burning tears into my eyes which make it a hard task to write to you. All
      this I know, and yet I dare not believe in myself. It is useless to deny
      it, Carmina&mdash;I love him. Even now, when you have found me out, I love
      him. Don&rsquo;t trust me. Oh, God, what torture it is to write it&mdash;but I
      do write it, I <i>will</i> write it&mdash;don&rsquo;t trust me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;One thing I may say for myself. I know the utter hopelessness of that
      love which I have acknowledged. I know that he returns your love, and will
      never return mine. So let it be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am not young; I have no right to comfort myself with hopes that I know
      to be vain. If one of us is to suffer, let it be that one who is used to
      suffering. I have never been the darling of my parents, like you; I have
      not been used at home to the kindness and the love that you remember. A
      life without sweetness and joy has well fitted me for a loveless future.
      And, besides, you are worthy of him, and I am not. Mrs. Gallilee is wrong,
      Carmina, if she thinks I am your rival. I am not your rival; I never can
      be your rival. Believe nothing else, but, for God&rsquo;s sake, believe that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have no more to say&mdash;at least no more that I can remember now.
      Perhaps, you shrink from remaining in the same house with me? Let me know
      it, and I shall be ready&mdash;I might almost say, glad&mdash;to go.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read her letter, Teresa? Am I wrong in feeling that this poor
      wounded heart has surely some claim on me? If I <i>am</i> wrong, oh, what
      am I to do? what am I to do?&rdquo;

      The last lines addressed by Carmina to her old nurse were completed on the
      seventeenth of August, and were posted that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day that followed was memorable to Carmina, and memorable to Mrs.
      Gallilee. Doctor Benjulia had his reasons also for remembering the
      eighteenth of August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still in search of a means to undermine the confidence which united Ovid
      and Carmina, and still calling on her invention in vain, Mrs. Gallilee had
      passed a sleepless night. Her maid, entering the room at the usual hour,
      was ordered to leave her in bed, and not to return until the bell rang. On
      ordinary occasions, Mrs. Gallilee was up in time to receive the letters
      arriving by the first delivery; the correspondence of the other members of
      the household being sorted by her own hands, before it was distributed by
      the servant. On this particular morning (after sleeping a little through
      sheer exhaustion), she entered the empty breakfast-room two hours later
      than usual. The letters waiting for her were addressed only to herself.
      She rang for the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other letters this morning?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two, for my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;except a telegram for Miss Carmina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did it come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon after the letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you given it to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being a telegram, ma&rsquo;am, I thought I ought to take it to Miss Carmina at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. You can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A telegram for Carmina? Was there some private correspondence going on?
      And were the interests involved too important to wait for the ordinary
      means of communication by post? Considering these questions, Mrs. Gallilee
      poured out a cup of tea and looked over her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one of them especially attracted her notice in her present frame of
      mind. The writer was Benjulia. He dispensed as usual with the customary
      forms of address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a letter about Ovid, from a friend of mine in Canada. There is
      an allusion to him of the complimentary sort, which I don&rsquo;t altogether
      understand. I want to ask you about it&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t spare the time to
      go a-visiting. So much the better for me&mdash;I hate conversation, and I
      like work. You have got your carriage&mdash;and your fine friends are out
      of town. If you want a drive, come to me, and bring your last letters from
      Ovid with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee decided on considering this characteristic proposal later in
      the day. Her first and foremost interest took her upstairs to her niece&rsquo;s
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina had left her bed. Robed in her white dressing-gown, she lay on the
      sofa in the sitting-room. When her aunt came in, she started and shuddered
      Those signs of nervous aversion escaped the notice of Mrs. Gallilee. Her
      attention had been at once attracted by a travelling bag, opened as if in
      preparation for packing. The telegram lay on Carmina&rsquo;s lap. The
      significant connection between those two objects asserted itself plainly.
      But it was exactly the opposite of the connection suspected by Mrs.
      Gallilee. The telegram had prevented Carmina from leaving the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee paved the way for the necessary investigation, by making a
      few common-place inquiries. How had Carmina passed the night? Had the maid
      taken care of her at breakfast-time? Was there anything that her aunt
      could do for her? Carmina replied with a reluctance which she was unable
      to conceal. Mrs. Gallilee passed over the cold reception accorded to her
      without remark, and pointed with a bland smile to the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No bad news, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina handed the telegram silently to her aunt. The change of
      circumstances which the arrival of the message had produced, made
      concealment superfluous. Mrs. Gallilee opened the telegram, keeping her
      suspicions in reserve. It had been sent from Rome by the old foreign
      woman, named &ldquo;Teresa,&rdquo; and it contained these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband died this morning. Expect me in London from day to day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is this person coming to London?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stung by the insolent composure of that question, Carmina answered
      sharply, &ldquo;Her name is on the telegram; you ought to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;Perhaps, she likes London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hates London! You have had her in the house; you have seen us
      together. Now she has lost her husband, do you think she can live apart
      from the one person in the world whom she loves best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, these matters of mere sentiment escape my notice,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee
      rejoined. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an expensive journey from Italy to England. What was her
      husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband was foreman in a manufactory till his health failed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee concluded, &ldquo;the money failed him, of course.
      What did he manufacture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Artists&rsquo; colours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! an artists&rsquo; colourman? Not a very lucrative business, I should think.
      Has his widow any resources of her own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My purse is hers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very generous, I am sure! Even the humblest lodgings are dear in this
      neighbourhood. However&mdash;with your assistance&mdash;your old servant
      may be able to live somewhere near you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having settled the question of Teresa&rsquo;s life in London in this way, Mrs.
      Gallilee returned to the prime object of her suspicion&mdash;she took
      possession of the travelling bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina looked at her with the submission of utter bewilderment. Teresa
      had been the companion of her life; Teresa had been received as her
      attendant, when she was first established under her aunt&rsquo;s roof. She had
      assumed that her nurse would become a member of the household again, as a
      matter of course. With Teresa to encourage her, she had summoned the
      resolution to live with Ovid&rsquo;s mother, until Ovid came back. And now she
      had been informed, in words too plain to be mistaken, that Teresa must
      find a home for herself when she returned to London! Surprise,
      disappointment, indignation held Carmina speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This thing,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee proceeded, holding up the bag, &ldquo;will only be
      in your way here. I will have it put with our own bags and boxes, in the
      lumber-room. And, by-the-bye, I fancy you don&rsquo;t quite understand
      (naturally enough, at your age) our relative positions in this house. My
      child, the authority of your late father is the authority which your
      guardian holds over you. I hope never to be obliged to exercise it&mdash;especially,
      if you will be good enough to remember two things. I expect you to consult
      me in your choice of companions; and to wait for my approval before you
      make arrangements which&mdash;well! let us say, which require the bag to
      be removed from the lumber-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for a reply, she turned to the door. After opening it, she
      paused&mdash;and looked back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought of what I told you, last night?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorely as they had been tried, Carmina&rsquo;s energies rallied at this. &ldquo;I have
      done my best to forget it!&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Miss Minerva&rsquo;s request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina took no notice of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee persisted. &ldquo;Have you had any communication with that
      person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was still no reply. Preserving her temper, Mrs. Gallilee stepped out
      on the landing, and called to Miss Minerva. The governess answered from
      the upper floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please come down here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Galilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva obeyed. Her face was paler than usual; her eyes had lost
      something of their piercing brightness. She stopped outside Carmina&rsquo;s
      door. Mrs. Gallilee requested her to enter the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an instant&mdash;only an instant&mdash;of hesitation, Miss Minerva
      crossed the threshold. She cast one quick glance at Carmina, and lowered
      her eyes before the look could be returned. Mrs. Gallilee discovered no
      mute signs of an understanding between them. She turned to the governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been here already this morning?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there some coolness between you and my niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, madam, that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why don&rsquo;t you speak to her when you come into the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Carmina has been ill. I see her resting on the sofa&mdash;and I am
      unwilling to disturb her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even by saying good-morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are exceedingly careful, Miss Minerva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had some experience of sick people, and I have learnt to be
      careful. May I ask if you have any particular reason for calling me
      downstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee prepared to put her niece and her governess to the final
      test.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you to suspend the children&rsquo;s lesson for an hour or two,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Shall I tell them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I will tell them myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish me to do?&rdquo; said Miss Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you to remain here with my niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Gallilee, after answering in those terms, had looked at her niece,
      instead of looking at her governess, she would have seen Carmina&mdash;distrustful
      of her own self-control&mdash;move on the sofa so as to turn her face to
      the wall. As it was, Miss Minerva&rsquo;s attitude and look silently claimed
      some explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee addressed her in a whisper. &ldquo;Let me say a word to you at the
      door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva followed her to the landing outside. Carmina turned again,
      listening anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all satisfied with her looks, this morning,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee
      proceeded; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think it right she should be left alone. My
      household duties must be attended to. Will you take my place at the sofa,
      until Mr. Null comes?&rdquo; (<i>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;</i> she thought, &ldquo;if there is jealousy
      between them, I shall see it!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw nothing: the governess quietly bowed to her, and went back to
      Carmina. She heard nothing: although the half-closed door gave her
      opportunities for listening. Ignorant, she had entered the room. Ignorant,
      she left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina lay still and silent. With noiseless step, Miss Minerva approached
      the sofa, and stood by it, waiting. Neither of them lifted her eyes, the
      one to the other. The woman suffered her torture in secret. The girl&rsquo;s
      sweet eyes filled slowly with tears. One by one the minutes of the morning
      passed&mdash;not many in number, before there was a change. In silence,
      Carmina held out her hand. In silence, Miss Minerva took it and kissed it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee saw her housekeeper as usual, and gave her orders for the
      day. &ldquo;If there is anything forgotten,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I must leave it to you.
      For the next hour or two, don&rsquo;t let me be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of her letters of the morning were still unread, others required
      immediate acknowledgment. She was not as ready for her duties as usual.
      For once, the most unendurably industrious of women was idle, and sat
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even her unimaginative nature began to tremble on the verge of
      superstition. Twice, had the subtle force of circumstances defeated her,
      in the attempt to meddle with the contemplated marriage of her son. By
      means of the music-master, she had planned to give Ovid jealous reasons
      for doubting Carmina&mdash;and she had failed. By means of the governess,
      she had planned to give Carmina jealous reasons for doubting Ovid&mdash;and
      she had failed. When some people talked of Fatality, were they quite such
      fools as she had hitherto supposed them to be? It would be a waste of time
      to inquire. What next step could she take?
    </p>
    <p>
      Urged by the intolerable sense of defeat to find reasons for still looking
      hopefully to the future, the learned Mrs. Gallilee lowered herself to the
      intellectual level of the most ignorant servant in the house. The modern
      Muse of Science unconsciously opened her mind to the vulgar belief in
      luck. She said to herself, as her kitchen-maid might have said, We will
      see what comes of it, the third time!
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia&rsquo;s letter was among the other letters waiting on the table. She
      took it up, and read it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her present frame of mind, to find her thoughts occupied by the doctor,
      was to be reminded of Ovid&rsquo;s strange allusion to his professional
      colleague, on the day of his departure. Speaking of Carmina, he had
      referred to one person whom he did not wish her to see in his absence; and
      that person, he had himself admitted to be Benjulia. He had been asked to
      state his objection to the doctor&mdash;and how had he replied? He had
      said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Benjulia a fit person to be in the company of a young
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many men of mature age, who are not fit persons to be in the
      company of young girls&mdash;but they are either men who despise, or men
      who admire, young girls. Benjulia belonged neither to the one nor to the
      other of these two classes. Girls were objects of absolute indifference to
      him&mdash;with the one exception of Zo, aged ten. Never yet, after meeting
      him in society hundreds of times, had Mrs. Gallilee seen him talk to young
      ladies or even notice young ladies. Ovid&rsquo;s alleged reason for objecting to
      Benjulia stood palpably revealed as a clumsy excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present posture of events, to arrive at that conclusion was enough
      for Mrs. Gallilee. Without stopping to pursue the idea, she rang the bell,
      and ordered her carriage to be ready that afternoon, at three o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtful, and more than doubtful, though it might be, the bare prospect of
      finding herself possessed, before the day was out, of a means of action
      capable of being used against Carmina, raised Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s spirits. She
      was ready at last to attend to her correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the letters was from her sister in Scotland. Among other subjects,
      it referred to Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you let that sweet girl come and stay with us?&rdquo; Lady Northlake
      asked. &ldquo;My daughters are longing for such a companion; and both my sons
      are ready to envy Ovid the moment they see her. Tell my nephew, when you
      next write, that I thoroughly understand his falling in love with that
      gentle pretty creature at first sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s illness was the ready excuse which presented itself in Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s reply. With or without an excuse, Lady Northlake was to be
      resolutely prevented from taking a foremost place in her niece&rsquo;s heart,
      and encouraging the idea of her niece&rsquo;s marriage. Mrs. Gallilee felt
      almost pious enough to thank Heaven that her sister&rsquo;s palace in the
      Highlands was at one end of Great Britain, and her own marine villa at the
      other!
    </p>
    <p>
      The marine villa reminded her of the family migration to the sea-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When would it be desirable to leave London? Not until her mind was
      relieved of the heavier anxieties that now weighed on it. Not while events
      might happen&mdash;in connection with the threatening creditors or the
      contemplated marriage&mdash;which would baffle her latest calculations,
      and make her presence in London a matter of serious importance to her own
      interests. Miss Minerva, again, was a new obstacle in the way. To take her
      to the Isle of Wight was not to be thought of for a moment. To dismiss her
      at once, by paying the month&rsquo;s salary, might be the preferable course to
      pursue&mdash;but for two objections. In the first place (if the friendly
      understanding between them really continued) Carmina might communicate
      with the discarded governess in secret. In the second place, to pay Miss
      Minerva&rsquo;s salary before she had earned it, was a concession from which
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s spite, and Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s principles of paltry economy,
      recoiled in disgust. No! the waiting policy in London, under whatever
      aspect it might be viewed, was, for the present, the one policy to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the demands of her correspondence. Just as she had taken
      up her pen, the sanctuary of the boudoir was violated by the appearance of
      a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now? Didn&rsquo;t the housekeeper tell you that I am not to be
      disturbed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am. My master&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your master want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wishes to see you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a circumstance entirely without parallel in the domestic history
      of the house. In sheer astonishment, Mrs. Gallilee pushed away her
      letters, and said &ldquo;Show him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the boys of fifty years since were naughty, the schoolmaster of the
      period was not accustomed to punish them by appealing to their sense of
      honour. If a boy wanted a flogging, in those days, the educational system
      seized a cane, or a birch-rod, and gave it to him. Mr. Gallilee entered
      his wife&rsquo;s room, with the feelings which had once animated him, on
      entering the schoolmaster&rsquo;s study to be caned. When he said &ldquo;Good-morning,
      my dear!&rdquo; his face presented the expression of fifty years since, when he
      had said, &ldquo;Please, sir, let me off this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little word. How well you&rsquo;re looking, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a sleepless night, followed by her defeat in Carmina&rsquo;s room, Mrs.
      Gallilee looked, and knew that she looked, ugly and old. And her wretched
      husband had reminded her of it. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she answered sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee moistened his dry lips. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take a chair, if you
      will allow me,&rdquo; he said. Having taken his chair (at a respectful distance
      from his wife), he looked all round the room with the air of a visitor who
      had never seen it before. &ldquo;How very pretty!&rdquo; he remarked softly. &ldquo;Such
      taste in colour. I think the carpet was your own design, wasn&rsquo;t it? How
      chaste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Will</i> you come to the point, Mr. Gallilee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, my dear&mdash;with pleasure. I&rsquo;m afraid I smell of
      tobacco?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was such an agreeable surprise to Mr. Gallilee, that he got on his
      legs again to enjoy it standing up. &ldquo;How kind! Really now, how kind!&rdquo; He
      approached Mrs. Gallilee confidentially. &ldquo;And do you know, my dear, it was
      one of the most remarkable cigars I ever smoked.&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee laid down
      her pen, and eyed him with an annihilating frown. In the extremity of his
      confusion Mr. Gallilee ventured nearer. He felt the sinister fascination
      of the serpent in the expression of those awful eyebrows. &ldquo;How well you
      are looking! How amazingly well you are looking this morning!&rdquo; He leered
      at his learned wife, and patted her shoulder!
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, Mrs. Gallilee was petrified. At his time of life, was this
      fat and feeble creature approaching her with conjugal endearments? At that
      early hour of the day, had his guilty lips tasted his favourite champagne,
      foaming in his well-beloved silver mug, over his much-admired lump of ice?
      And was <i>this</i> the result?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gallilee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been to the club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee got up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee sat down. &ldquo;I was about to say, my dear, that I&rsquo;ll show you
      over the club with the greatest pleasure&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not a downright idiot,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee, &ldquo;understand this!
      Either say what you have to say, or&mdash;&rdquo; she lifted her hand, and let
      it down on the writing-table with a slap that made the pens ring in the
      inkstand&mdash;&ldquo;or, leave the room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee lifted his hand, and searched in the breast-pocket of his
      coat. He pulled out his cigar-case, and put it back in a hurry. He tried
      again, and produced a letter. He looked piteously round the room, in sore
      need of somebody whom he might appeal to, and ended in appealing to
      himself. &ldquo;What sort of temper will she be in?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee asked sharply. &ldquo;One of the
      letters you had this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee looked at her with admiration. &ldquo;Wonderful woman!&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Nothing escapes her! Allow me, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and presented the letter, as if he was presenting a petition. Mrs.
      Gallilee snatched it out of his hand. Mr. Gallilee went softly back to his
      chair, and breathed a devout ejaculation. &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a letter from one of the tradespeople, whom Mrs. Gallilee had
      attempted to pacify with a payment &ldquo;on account.&rdquo; The tradesman felt
      compelled, in justice to himself, to appeal to Mr. Gallilee, as master of
      the house (!). It was impossible for him (he submitted with the greatest
      respect) to accept a payment, which did not amount to one-third of the sum
      owing to him for more than a twelvemonth. &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gallilee.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle his bill, and never employ him again!&rdquo; She opened her
      cheque-book, and dipped her pen in the ink. A faint voice meekly
      protested. Mr. Gallilee was on his legs again. Mr. Gallilee said. &ldquo;Please
      don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His incredible rashness silenced his wife. There he stood; his round eyes
      staring at the cheque-book, his fat cheeks quivering with excitement. &ldquo;You
      mustn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he said, with a first and last outburst of courage. &ldquo;Give
      me a minute, my dear&mdash;oh, good gracious, give me a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He searched in his pocket again, and produced another letter. His eyes
      wandered towards the door; drops of perspiration oozed out on his
      forehead. He laid the second letter on the table; he looked at his wife,
      and&mdash;ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee opened the second letter. Another dissatisfied tradesman?
      No: creditors far more formidable than the grocer and the butcher. An
      official letter from the bankers, informing Mr. Gallilee that &ldquo;the account
      was overdrawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized her pass-book, and her paper of calculations. Never yet had her
      rigid arithmetic committed an error. Column by column she revised her
      figures&mdash;and made the humiliating discovery of her first mistake. She
      had drawn out all, and more than all, the money deposited in the bank; and
      the next half-yearly payment of income was not due until Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one thing to be done&mdash;to go at once to the bank. If
      Ovid had not been in the wilds of Canada, Mrs. Gallilee would have made
      her confession to him without hesitation. As it was, the servant called a
      cab, and she made her confession to the bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was soon settled to her satisfaction. It rested (exactly as
      Miss Minerva had anticipated) with Mr. Gallilee. In the house, he might
      abdicate his authority to his heart&rsquo;s content. Out of the house, in
      matters of business, he was master still. His &ldquo;investments&rdquo; represented
      excellent &ldquo;security;&rdquo; he had only to say how much he wanted to borrow, and
      to sign certain papers&mdash;and the thing was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee went home again, with her pecuniary anxieties at rest for
      the time. The carriage was waiting for her at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should she fulfil her intention of visiting Benjulia? She was not a person
      who readily changed her mind&mdash;and, besides, after the troubles of the
      morning, the drive into the country would be a welcome relief. Hearing
      that Mr. Gallilee was still at home, she looked in at the smoking-room.
      Unerring instinct told her where to find her husband, under present
      circumstances. There he was, enjoying his cigar in comfort, with his coat
      off and his feet on a chair. She opened the door. &ldquo;I want you, this
      evening,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and shut the door again; leaving Mr. Gallilee
      suffocated by a mouthful of his own smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before getting into the carriage, she only waited to restore her face with
      a flush of health (from Paris), modified by a sprinkling of pallor (from
      London). Benjulia&rsquo;s humour was essentially an uncertain humour. It might
      be necessary to fascinate the doctor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The complimentary allusion to Ovid, which Benjulia had not been able to
      understand, was contained in a letter from Mr. Morphew, and was expressed
      in these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Let me sincerely thank you for making us acquainted
      with Mr. Ovid Vere. Now that he has left us, we really feel as if we had
      said good-bye to an old friend. I don&rsquo;t know when I have met with such a
      perfectly unselfish man&mdash;and I say this, speaking from experience of
      him. In my unavoidable absence, he volunteered to attend a serious case of
      illness, accompanied by shocking circumstances&mdash;and this at a time
      when, as you know, his own broken health forbids him to undertake any
      professional duty. While he could preserve the patient&rsquo;s life&mdash;and he
      did wonders, in this way&mdash;he was every day at the bedside, taxing his
      strength in the service of a perfect stranger. I fancy I see you (with
      your impatience of letter-writing at any length) looking to the end. Don&rsquo;t
      be alarmed. I am writing to your brother Lemuel by this mail, and I have
      little time to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was this &ldquo;serious case of illness&rdquo;&mdash;described as being &ldquo;accompanied
      by shocking circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;a case of disease of the brain?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the question, proposed by Benjulia&rsquo;s inveterate suspicion of
      Ovid! The bare doubt cost him the loss of a day&rsquo;s work. He reviled poor
      Mr. Morphew as &ldquo;a born idiot&rdquo; for not having plainly stated what the
      patient&rsquo;s malady was, instead of wasting paper on smooth sentences,
      encumbered by long words. If Ovid had alluded to his Canadian patient in
      his letters to his mother, his customary preciseness of language might be
      trusted to relieve Benjulia&rsquo;s suspense. With that purpose in view, the
      doctor had written to Mrs. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he laid down his pen, he looked once more at Mr. Morphew&rsquo;s letter,
      and paused thoughtfully over one line: &ldquo;I am writing to your brother
      Lemuel by this mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The information of which he was in search might be in <i>that</i> letter.
      If Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s correspondence with her son failed to enlighten him,
      here was another chance of making the desired discovery. Surely the wise
      course to take would be to write to Lemuel as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      His one motive for hesitating was dislike of his younger brother&mdash;dislike
      so inveterate that he even recoiled from communicating with Lemuel through
      the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had never been any sympathy between them; but indifference had only
      matured into downright enmity, on the doctor&rsquo;s part, a year since.
      Accident (the result of his own absence of mind, while he was perplexed by
      an unsuccessful experiment) had placed Lemuel in possession of his hideous
      secret. The one person in the world who knew how he was really occupied in
      the laboratory, was his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the true motive of the bitterly contemptuous tone in which
      Benjulia had spoken to Ovid of his nearest relation. Lemuel&rsquo;s character
      was certainly deserving of severe judgment, in some of its aspects. In his
      hours of employment (as clerk in the office of a London publisher) he
      steadily and punctually performed the duties entrusted to him. In his
      hours of freedom, his sensual instincts got the better of him; and his
      jealous wife had her reasons for complaint. Among his friends, he was the
      subject of a wide diversity of opinion. Some of them agreed with his
      brother in thinking him little better than a fool. Others suspected him of
      possessing natural abilities, but of being too lazy, perhaps too cunning,
      to exert them. In the office he allowed himself to be called &ldquo;a mere
      machine&rdquo;&mdash;and escaped the overwork which fell to the share of quicker
      men. When his wife and her relations declared him to be a mere animal, he
      never contradicted them&mdash;and so gained the reputation of a person on
      whom reprimand was thrown away. Under the protection of this unenviable
      character, he sometimes said severe things with an air of perfect
      simplicity. When the furious doctor discovered him in the laboratory, and
      said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the death of you, if you tell any living creature what I am
      doing!&rdquo;&mdash;Lemuel answered, with a stare of stupid astonishment, &ldquo;Make
      your mind easy; I should be ashamed to mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Further reflection decided Benjulia on writing. Even when he had a favour
      to ask, he was unable to address Lemuel with common politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear that Morphew has written to you by the last mail. I want to see
      the letter.&rdquo; So much he wrote, and no more. What was barely enough for the
      purpose, was enough for the doctor, when he addressed his brother.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between one and two o&rsquo;clock, the next afternoon, Benjulia (at work in his
      laboratory) heard the bell which announced the arrival of a visitor at the
      house. No matter what the circumstances might be, the servants were
      forbidden to disturb him at his studies in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very unwillingly he obeyed the call, locking the door behind him. At that
      hour it was luncheon-time in well-regulated households, and it was in the
      last degree unlikely that Mrs. Gallilee could be the visitor. Getting
      within view of the front of the house, he saw a man standing on the
      doorstep. Advancing a little nearer, he recognised Lemuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried the elder brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; answered the younger, like an echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood looking at each other with the suspicious curiosity of two
      strange cats. Between Nathan Benjulia, the famous doctor, and Lemuel
      Benjulia, the publisher&rsquo;s clerk, there was just family resemblance enough
      to suggest that they were relations. The younger brother was only a little
      over the ordinary height; he was rather fat than thin; he wore a moustache
      and whiskers; he dressed smartly&mdash;and his prevailing expression
      announced that he was thoroughly well satisfied with himself. But he
      inherited Benjulia&rsquo;s gipsy complexion; and, in form and colour, he had
      Benjulia&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How-d&rsquo;ye-do, Nathan?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil brings you here?&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel passed over his brother&rsquo;s rudeness without notice. His mouth curled
      up at the corners with a mischievous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you wished to see my letter,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you send it by post?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife wished me to take the opportunity of calling on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said Benjulia quietly. &ldquo;Try another excuse. Or do a new
      thing. For once, speak the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting to hear the truth, he led the way into the room in which
      he had received Ovid. Lemuel followed, still showing no outward appearance
      of resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get away from your office?&rdquo; Benjulia inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to get a holiday at this time of year. Business is slack, old
      boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! I don&rsquo;t allow you to speak to me in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offence, brother Nathan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Lemuel, I never allow a fool to offend me. I put him in his place&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The distant barking of a dog became audible from the lane by which the
      house was approached. The sound seemed to annoy Benjulia. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel saw his way to making some return for his brother&rsquo;s reception of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my dog,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s lucky for you that I have left him in
      the cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s as sweet-tempered a dog as ever lived. But he has one fault.
      He doesn&rsquo;t take kindly to scientific gentlemen in your line of business.&rdquo;
       Lemuel paused, and pointed to his brother&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;If he smelt that, he
      might try his teeth at vivisecting You.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spots of blood which Ovid had once seen on Benjulia&rsquo;s stick, were on
      his hands now. With unruffled composure he looked at the horrid stains,
      silently telling their tale of torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of washing my hands,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;when I am going back
      to my work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wiped his finger and thumb on the tail of his coat. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he resumed,
      &ldquo;if you have got your letter with you, let me look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel produced the letter. &ldquo;There are some bits in it,&rdquo; he explained,
      &ldquo;which you had better not see. If you want the truth&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
      reason I brought it myself. Read the first page-and then I&rsquo;ll tell you
      where to skip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far, there was no allusion to Ovid. Benjulia turned to the second page&mdash;and
      Lemuel pointed to the middle of it. &ldquo;Read as far as that,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;and then skip till you come to the last bit at the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the last page, Ovid&rsquo;s name appeared. He was mentioned, as a &ldquo;delightful
      person, introduced by your brother,&rdquo;&mdash;and with that the letter ended.
      In the first bitterness of his disappointment, Benjulia conceived an angry
      suspicion of those portions of the letter which he had been requested to
      pass over unread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Morphew got to say to you that I mustn&rsquo;t read?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you tell me first, what you want to find in the letter,&rdquo; Lemuel
      rejoined. &ldquo;Morphew is a doctor like you. Is it anything medical?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia answered this in the easiest way&mdash;he nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Vivisection?&rdquo; Lemuel inquired slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia at once handed the letter back, and pointed to the door. His
      momentary interest in the suppressed passages was at an end. &ldquo;That will
      do,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Take yourself and your letter away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Lemuel, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t want to look at it again!&rdquo; He put
      the letter away, and buttoned his coat, and tapped his pocket
      significantly. &ldquo;You have got a nasty temper, Nathan&mdash;and there are
      things here that might try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the case of any other man, Benjulia would have seen that the one object
      of these prudent remarks was to irritate him. Misled by his profound
      conviction of his brother&rsquo;s stupidity, he now thought it possible that the
      concealed portions of the letter might be worth notice. He stopped Lemuel
      at the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I want to look at the
      letter again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better not,&rdquo; Lemuel persisted. &ldquo;Morphew&rsquo;s going to write a book
      against you&mdash;and he asks me to get it published at our place. I&rsquo;m on
      his side, you know; I shall do my best to help him; I can lay my hand on
      literary fellows who will lick his style into shape&mdash;it will be an
      awful exposure!&rdquo; Benjulia still held out his hand. With over-acted
      reluctance, Lemuel unbuttoned his coat. The distant dog barked again as he
      gave the letter back. &ldquo;Please excuse my dear old dog,&rdquo; he said with
      maudlin tenderness; &ldquo;the poor dumb animal seems to know that I&rsquo;m taking
      his side in the controversy. <i>Bow-wow</i> means, in his language, Fie
      upon the cruel hands that bore holes in our head and use saws on our
      backs. Ah, Nathan, if you have got any dogs in that horrid place of yours,
      pat them and give them their dinner! You never heard me talk like this
      before&mdash;did you? I&rsquo;m a new man since I joined the Society for
      suppressing you. Oh, if I only had the gift of writing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this experiment on his brother&rsquo;s temper, failed to fulfil
      Lemuel&rsquo;s expectations. The doctor&rsquo;s curiosity was roused on the doctor&rsquo;s
      own subject of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right about one thing,&rdquo; said Benjulia gravely; &ldquo;I never
      heard you talk in this way before. You suggest some interesting
      considerations, of the medical sort. Come to the light.&rdquo; He led Lemuel to
      the window&mdash;looked at him with the closest attention&mdash;and
      carefully consulted his pulse. Lemuel smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking,&rdquo; said
      Benjulia sternly. &ldquo;Tell me this. Have you had headaches lately? Do you
      find your memory failing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he put those questions, he thought to himself&mdash;seriously thought&mdash;&ldquo;Is
      this fellow&rsquo;s brain softening? I wish I had him on my table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel persisted in presenting himself under a sentimental aspect. He had
      not forgiven his elder brother&rsquo;s rudeness yet&mdash;and he knew, by
      experience, the one weakness in Benjulia&rsquo;s character which, with his small
      resources, it was possible to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your kind inquiries,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Never mind my head, so
      long as my heart&rsquo;s in the right place. I don&rsquo;t pretend to be clever&mdash;but
      I&rsquo;ve got my feelings; and I could put some awkward questions on what you
      call Medical Research, if I had Morphew to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; said Benjulia&mdash;interested in developing the state of
      his brother&rsquo;s brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; said Lemuel&mdash;interested in developing the
      state of his brother&rsquo;s temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try me, Lemuel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Nathan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers returned to their chairs; reduced for once to the same
      moral level.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Benjulia, &ldquo;what is it to be? The favourite public bugbear?
      Vivisection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me first,&rdquo; said Lemuel, &ldquo;what is Law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, what <i>ought</i> it to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Justice, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me wait a bit, Nathan, and get that into my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia waited with exemplary patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now about yourself,&rdquo; Lemuel continued. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be offended&mdash;will
      you? Should I be right, if I called you a dissector of living creatures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia was reminded of the day when he had discovered his brother in the
      laboratory. His dark complexion deepened in hue. His cold gray eyes seemed
      to promise a coming outbreak. Lemuel went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the Law forbid you to make your experiments on a man?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it does!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t the Law forbid you to make your experiments on a dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia&rsquo;s face cleared again. The one penetrable point in his ironclad
      nature had not been reached yet. That apparently childish question about
      the dog appeared, not only to have interested him, but to have taken him
      by surprise. His attention wandered away from his brother. His clear
      intellect put Lemuel&rsquo;s objection in closer logical form, and asked if
      there was any answer to it, thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Law which forbids you to dissect a living man, allows you to dissect a
      living dog. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was positively no answer to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose he said, Because a dog is an animal? Could he, as a physiologist,
      deny that a man is an animal too?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose he said, Because a dog is the inferior creature in intellect? The
      obvious answer to this would be, But the lower order of savage, or the
      lower order of lunatic, compared with the dog, is the inferior creature in
      intellect; and, in these cases, the dog has, on your own showing, the
      better right to protection of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose he said, Because a man is a creature with a soul, and a dog is a
      creature without a soul? This would be simply inviting another
      unanswerable question: How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly accepting the dilemma which thus presented itself, the conclusion
      that followed seemed to be beyond dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Law, in the matter of Vivisection, asserts the principle of
      interference, the Law has barred its right to place arbitrary limits on
      its own action. If it protects any living creatures, it is bound, in
      reason and in justice, to protect all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lemuel, &ldquo;am I to have an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this convenient reply, Benjulia opened Mr. Morphew&rsquo;s letter, and read
      the forbidden part of it which began on the second page. There he found
      the very questions with which his brother had puzzled him&mdash;followed
      by the conclusion at which he had himself arrived!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You interpreted the language of your dog just now,&rdquo; he said quietly to
      Lemuel; &ldquo;and I naturally supposed your brain might be softening. Such as
      it is, I perceive that your memory is in working order. Accept my excuses
      for feeling your pulse. You have ceased to be an object of interest to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his reading. Lemuel watched him&mdash;still confidently
      waiting for results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter proceeded in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your employer may perhaps be inclined to publish my work, if I can
      satisfy him that it will address itself to the general reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all know what are the false pretences, under which English
      physiologists practice their cruelties. I want to expose those false
      pretences in the simplest and plainest way, by appealing to my own
      experience as an ordinary working member of the medical profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the pretence of increasing our knowledge of the curative action of
      poisons, by trying them on animals. The very poisons, the action of which
      dogs and cats have been needlessly tortured to demonstrate, I have
      successfully used on my human patients in the practice of a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should also like to ask what proof there is that the effect of a poison
      on an animal may be trusted to inform us, with certainty, of the effect of
      the same poison on a man. To quote two instances only which justify doubt&mdash;and
      to take birds this time, by way of a change&mdash;a pigeon will swallow
      opium enough to kill a man, and will not be in the least affected by it;
      and parsley, which is an innocent herb in the stomach of a human being, is
      deadly poison to a parrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should deal in the same way, with the other pretence, of improving our
      practice of surgery by experiment on living animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long since, I saw the diseased leg of a dog cut off at the hip joint.
      When the limb was removed, not a single vessel bled. Try the same
      operation on a man&mdash;and twelve or fifteen vessels must be tied as a
      matter of absolute necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again. We are told by a great authority that the baking of dogs in ovens
      has led to new discoveries in treating fever. I have always supposed that
      the heat, in fever, is not a cause of disease, but a consequence. However,
      let that be, and let us still stick to experience. Has this infernal
      cruelty produced results which help us to cure scarlet fever? Our bedside
      practice tells us that scarlet fever runs it course as it always did. I
      can multiply such examples as these by hundreds when I write my book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Briefly stated, you now have the method by which I propose to drag the
      scientific English Savage from his shelter behind the medical interests of
      humanity, and to show him in his true character,&mdash;as plainly as the
      scientific Foreign Savage shows himself of his own accord. <i>He</i>
      doesn&rsquo;t shrink behind false pretences. <i>He</i> doesn&rsquo;t add cant to
      cruelty. <i>He</i> boldly proclaims the truth:&mdash;I do it, because I
      like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia rose, and threw the letter on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I</i> proclaim the truth,&rdquo; he said; <i>&ldquo;I</i> do it because I like it.
      There are some few Englishmen who treat ignorant public opinion with the
      contempt that it deserves&mdash;and I am one of them.&rdquo; He pointed
      scornfully to the letter. &ldquo;That wordy old fool is right about the false
      pretences. Publish his book, and I&rsquo;ll buy a copy of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; said Lemuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s odd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nathan, I&rsquo;m only a fool&mdash;but if you talk in that way of false
      pretences and public opinion, why do you tell everybody that your horrid
      cutting and carving is harmless chemistry? And why were you in such a rage
      when I got into your workshop, and found you out? Answer me that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me congratulate you first,&rdquo; said Benjulia. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t every fool who
      knows that he <i>is</i> a fool. Now you shall have your answer. Before the
      end of the year, all the world will be welcome to come into my workshop,
      and see me at the employment of my life. Brother Lemuel, when you stole
      your way through my unlocked door, you found me travelling on the road to
      the grandest medical discovery of this century. You stupid ass, do you
      think I cared about what <i>you</i> could find out? I am in such perpetual
      terror of being forestalled by my colleagues, that I am not master of
      myself, even when such eyes as yours look at my work. In a month or two
      more&mdash;perhaps in a week or two&mdash;I shall have solved the grand
      problem. I labour at it all day. I think of it, I dream of it, all night.
      It will kill me. Strong as I am, it will kill me. What do you say? Am I
      working myself into my grave, in the medical interests of humanity? <i>That</i>
      for humanity! I am working for my own satisfaction&mdash;for my own pride&mdash;for
      my own unutterable pleasure in beating other men&mdash;for the fame that
      will keep my name living hundreds of years hence. Humanity! I say with my
      foreign brethren&mdash;Knowledge for its own sake, is the one god I
      worship. Knowledge is its own justification and its own reward. The
      roaring mob follows us with its cry of Cruelty. We pity their ignorance.
      Knowledge sanctifies cruelty. The old anatomist stole dead bodies for
      Knowledge. In that sacred cause, if I could steal a living man without
      being found out, I would tie him on my table, and grasp my grand discovery
      in days, instead of months. Where are you going? What? You&rsquo;re afraid to be
      in the same room with me? A man who can talk as I do, is a man who would
      stick at nothing? Is that the light in which you lower order of creatures
      look at us? Look a little higher&mdash;and you will see that a man who
      talks as I do is a man set above you by Knowledge. Exert yourself, and try
      to understand me. Have I no virtues, even from your point of view? Am I
      not a good citizen? Don&rsquo;t I pay my debts? Don&rsquo;t I serve my friends? You
      miserable creature, you have had my money when you wanted it! Look at that
      letter on the floor. The man mentioned in it is one of those colleagues
      whom I distrust. I did my duty by him for all that. I gave him the
      information he wanted; I introduced him to a friend in a land of
      strangers. Have I no feeling, as you call it? My last experiments on a
      monkey horrified me. His cries of suffering, his gestures of entreaty,
      were like the cries and gestures of a child. I would have given the world
      to put him out of his misery. But I went on. In the glorious cause I went
      on. My hands turned cold&mdash;my heart ached&mdash;I thought of a child I
      sometimes play with&mdash;I suffered&mdash;I resisted&mdash;I went on. All
      for Knowledge! all for Knowledge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His brother&rsquo;s presence was forgotten. His dark face turned livid; his
      gigantic frame shuddered; his breath came and went in deep sobbing gasps&mdash;it
      was terrible to see him and hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel slunk out of the room. The jackal had roused the lion; the mean
      spirit of mischief in him had not bargained for this. &ldquo;I begin to believe
      in the devil,&rdquo; he said to himself when he got to the house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he descended the steps, a carriage appeared in the lane. A footman
      opened the gate of the enclosure. The carriage approached the house, with
      a lady in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel ran back to his brother. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a lady coming!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      in a nice state to see her! Pull yourself together, Nathan&mdash;and, damn
      it, wash your hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Benjulia&rsquo;s arm, and led him upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lemuel returned to the hall, Mrs. Gallilee was ascending the
      house-steps. He bowed profoundly, in homage to the well-preserved remains
      of a fine woman. &ldquo;My brother will be with you directly, ma&rsquo;am. Pray allow
      me to give you a chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hat was in his hand. Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s knowledge of the world easily set
      him down at his true value. She got rid of him with her best grace. &ldquo;Pray
      don&rsquo;t let me detain you, sir; I will wait with pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she had been twenty years younger the hint might have been thrown away.
      As it was, Lemuel retired.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      An unusually long day&rsquo;s work at the office had fatigued good Mr. Mool. He
      pushed aside his papers, and let his weary eyes rest on a glass vase full
      of flowers on the table&mdash;a present from a grateful client. As a man,
      he enjoyed the lovely colours of the nosegay. As a botanist, he lamented
      the act which had cut the flowers from their parent stems, and doomed them
      to a premature death. &ldquo;I should not have had the heart to do it myself,&rdquo;
       he thought; &ldquo;but tastes differ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The office boy came into the room, with a visiting card in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home to dinner,&rdquo; said Mr. Mool. &ldquo;The person must call
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy laid the card on the table. The person was Mrs. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening! Mrs. Gallilee, without a
      previous appointment by letter! Mr. Mool trembled under the apprehension
      of some serious family emergency, in imminent need of legal interference.
      He submitted as a matter of course. &ldquo;Show the lady in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before a word had passed between them, the lawyer&rsquo;s mind was relieved.
      Mrs. Gallilee shone on him with her sweetest smiles; pressed his hand with
      her friendliest warmth; admired the nosegay with her readiest enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;Quite perfect,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;especially the Pansy. The round flat
      edge, Mr. Mool; the upper petals perfectly uniform&mdash;there is a flower
      that defies criticism! I long to dissect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool politely resigned the Pansy to dissection (murderous mutilation,
      he would have called it, in the case of one of his own flowers), and
      waited to hear what his learned client might have to say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to surprise you,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee announced. &ldquo;No&mdash;to shock
      you. No&mdash;even that is not strong enough. Let me say, to horrify you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool&rsquo;s anxieties returned, complicated by confusion. The behaviour of
      Mrs. Gallilee exhibited the most unaccountable contrast to her language.
      She showed no sign of those strong emotions to which she had alluded. &ldquo;How
      am I to put it?&rdquo; she went on, with a transparent affectation of
      embarrassment. &ldquo;Shall I call it a disgrace to our family?&rdquo; Mr. Mool
      started. Mrs. Gallilee entreated him to compose himself; she approached
      the inevitable disclosure by degrees. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have met
      Doctor Benjulia at my house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had that honour, Mrs. Gallilee. Not a very sociable person&mdash;if
      I may venture to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Downright rude, Mr. Mool, on some occasions. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter now.
      I have just been visiting the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was this visit connected with the &ldquo;disgrace to the family?&rdquo; Mr. Mool
      ventured to put a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Benjulia is not related to you, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world. Please don&rsquo;t interrupt me again. I am, so to
      speak, laying a train of circumstances before you; and I might leave one
      of them out. When Doctor Benjulia was a young man&mdash;I am returning to
      my train of circumstances, Mr. Mool&mdash;he was at Rome, pursuing his
      professional studies. I have all this, mind, straight from the doctor
      himself. At Rome, he became acquainted with my late brother, after the
      period of his unfortunate marriage. Stop! I have failed to put it strongly
      enough again. I ought to have said, his disgraceful marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mrs. Gallilee&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. The next circumstance is ready in my mind. One of the
      doctor&rsquo;s fellow-students (described as being personally an irresistible
      man) was possessed of abilities which even attracted our unsociable
      Benjulia. They became friends. At the time of which I am now speaking, my
      brother&rsquo;s disgusting wife&mdash;oh, but I repeat it, Mr. Mool! I say
      again, his disgusting wife&mdash;was the mother of a female child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your niece, Mrs. Gallilee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Miss Carmina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Carmina is no more my niece than she is your niece. Carry your mind
      back to what I have just said. I mentioned a medical student who was an
      irresistible man. Miss Carmina&rsquo;s father was that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool&rsquo;s astonishment and indignation would have instantly expressed
      themselves, if he had not been a lawyer. As it was, his professional
      experience warned him of the imprudence of speaking too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Galilee&rsquo;s exultation forced its way outwards. Her eyes glittered; her
      voice rose. &ldquo;The law, Mr. Mool! what does the law say?&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;Is
      my brother&rsquo;s Will no better than waste-paper? Is the money divided among
      his only near relations? Tell me! tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool suddenly plunged his face into his vase of flowers. Did he feel
      that the air of the office wanted purifying? or was he conscious that his
      face might betray him unless he hid it? Mrs. Galilee was at no loss to set
      her own clever interpretation on her lawyer&rsquo;s extraordinary proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; she said with the most patronising kindness. &ldquo;I know
      your sensitive nature; I know what I felt myself when this dreadful
      discovery burst upon me. If you remember, I said I should horrify you.
      Take your time, my dear sir&mdash;pray take your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be encouraged in this way&mdash;as if he was the emotional client, and
      Mrs. Gallilee the impassive lawyer&mdash;was more than even Mr. Mool could
      endure. Shy men are, in the innermost depths of their nature, proud men:
      the lawyer had his professional pride. He came out of his flowery retreat,
      with a steady countenance. For the first time in his life, he was not
      afraid of Mrs. Galilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we enter on the legal aspect of the case&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shocking case,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee interposed, in the interests of Virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under any other circumstances Mr. Mool would have accepted the correction.
      He actually took no notice of it now! &ldquo;There is one point,&rdquo; he proceeded,
      &ldquo;on which I must beg you to enlighten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means! I am ready to go into any details, no matter how disgusting
      they may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool thought of certain &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; (objects of perfectly needless
      respect among men) who, being requested to leave the Court, at
      unmentionable Trials, persist in keeping their places. It was a relief to
      him to feel&mdash;if his next questions did nothing else&mdash;that they
      would disappoint Mrs. Galilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I right in supposing that you believe what you have told me?&rdquo; he
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Doctor Benjulia the only person who has spoken to you on the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His information being derived from his friend&mdash;the fellow-student
      whom you mentioned just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee answered viciously, &ldquo;the father of the
      wretched girl who has been foisted on my care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Mool&rsquo;s courage had been in danger of failing him, he would have
      found it again now His regard for Carmina, his respect for the memory of
      her mother, had been wounded to the quick. Strong on his own legal ground,
      he proceeded as if he was examining a witness in a police court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the doctor had some reason for believing what his friend told
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ample reason! Vice and poverty generally go together&mdash;<i>this</i>
      man was poor. He showed Doctor Benjulia money received from his mistress&mdash;her
      husband&rsquo;s money, it is needless to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her motive might be innocent, Mrs. Gallilee. Had the man any letters of
      hers to show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters? From a woman in her position? It&rsquo;s notorious, Mr. Mool, that
      Italian models don&rsquo;t know how to read or write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask if there are any further proofs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had proofs enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all possible respect, ma&rsquo;am, I deny that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee had not been asked to enter into disgusting details. Mrs.
      Gallilee had been contradicted by her obedient humble servant of other
      days. She thought it high time to bring the examination to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are determined to believe in the woman&rsquo;s innocence,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;without knowing any of the circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool went on from bad to worse: he interrupted her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mrs. Gallilee, I think you have forgotten that one of my
      autumn holidays, many years since, was spent in Italy. I was in Rome, like
      Doctor Benjulia, after your brother&rsquo;s marriage. His wife was, to my
      certain knowledge, received in society. Her reputation was unblemished;
      and her husband was devoted to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In plain English,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee, &ldquo;my brother was a poor weak
      creature&mdash;and his wife, when you knew her, had not been found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just the difficulty I feel,&rdquo; Mr. Mool rejoined. &ldquo;How is it that
      she is only found out now? Years have passed since she died. More years
      have passed since this attack on her character reached Doctor Benjulia&rsquo;s
      knowledge. He is an old friend of yours. Why has he only told you of it
      to-day? I hope I don&rsquo;t offend you by asking these questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! your questions are so easily answered. I never encouraged
      the doctor to speak of my brother and his wife. The subject was too
      distasteful to me&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t doubt that Doctor Benjulia felt about
      it as I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until to-day,&rdquo; the lawyer remarked; &ldquo;Doctor Benjulia appears to have been
      quite ready to mention the subject to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under special circumstances, Mr. Mool. Perhaps, you will not allow that
      special circumstances make any difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, Mr. Mool made every allowance. At the same time, he
      waited to hear what the circumstances might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Galilee had her reasons for keeping silence. It was impossible to
      mention Benjulia&rsquo;s reception of her without inflicting a wound on her
      self-esteem. To begin with, he had kept the door of the room open, and had
      remained standing. &ldquo;Have you got Ovid&rsquo;s letters? Leave them here; I&rsquo;m not
      fit to look at them now.&rdquo; Those were his first words. There was nothing in
      the letters which a friend might not read: she accordingly consented to
      leave them. The doctor had expressed his sense of obligation by bidding
      her get into her carriage again, and go. &ldquo;I have been put in a passion; I
      have made a fool of myself; I haven&rsquo;t a nerve in my body that isn&rsquo;t
      quivering with rage. Go! go! go!&rdquo; There was his explanation. Impenetrably
      obstinate, Mrs. Galilee faced him&mdash;standing between the doctor and
      the door&mdash;without shrinking. She had not driven all the way to
      Benjulia&rsquo;s house to be sent back again without gaining her object: she had
      her questions to put to him, and she persisted in pressing them as only a
      woman can. He was left&mdash;with the education of a gentleman against him&mdash;between
      the two vulgar alternatives of turning her out by main force, or of
      yielding, and getting rid of her decently in that way. At any other time,
      he would have flatly refused to lower himself to the level of a
      scandal-mongering woman, by entering on the subject. In his present mood,
      if pacifying Mrs. Galilee, and ridding himself of Mrs. Gallilee, meant one
      and the same thing, he was ready, recklessly ready, to let her have her
      own way. She heard the infamous story, which she had repeated to her
      lawyer; and she had Lemuel Benjulia&rsquo;s visit, and Mr. Morphew&rsquo;s
      contemplated attack on Vivisection, to thank for getting her information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool waited, and waited in vain. He reminded his client of what she
      had just said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mentioned certain circumstances. May I know what they are?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee rose, before she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your time is valuable, and my time is valuable,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We shall not
      convince each other by prolonging our conversation. I came here, Mr. Mool,
      to ask you a question about the law. Permit me to remind you that I have
      not had my answer yet. My own impression is that the girl now in my house,
      not being my brother&rsquo;s child, has no claim on my brother&rsquo;s property? Tell
      me in two words, if you please&mdash;am I right or wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do it in one word, Mrs. Gallilee. Wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool entered on the necessary explanation, triumphing in the reply
      that he had just made. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the smartest thing,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I ever said
      in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While husbands and wives live together,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the Law holds
      that all children, born in wedlock, are the husband&rsquo;s children. Even if
      Miss Carmina&rsquo;s mother had not been as good and innocent a woman as ever
      drew the breath of life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Mr. Mool. You really mean to say that this girl&rsquo;s interest
      in my brother&rsquo;s Will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remains quite unaffected, ma&rsquo;am, by all that you have told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am still obliged to keep her under my care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; Mr. Mool answered, &ldquo;to resign the office of guardian, in favour of
      Lady Northlake&mdash;appointed to act, in your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trouble you any further, sir. Good-evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to leave the office. Mr. Mool actually tried to stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more, Mrs. Galilee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we have said enough already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool&rsquo;s audacity arrived at its climax. He put his hand on the lock of
      the office door, and held it shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady, Mrs. Gallilee! I am sure you will never breathe a word of
      this to the pretty gentle, young lady? Even if it was true; and, as God is
      my witness, I am sure it&rsquo;s false&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Mool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door, and let her go; her looks and tones told him that
      remonstrance was worse than useless. From year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end, this
      modest and amiable man had never been heard to swear. He swore now. &ldquo;Damn
      Doctor Benjulia!&rdquo; he burst out, in the solitude of his office. His dinner
      was waiting for him at home. Instead of putting on his hat, he went back
      to his writing-table. His thoughts projected themselves into the future&mdash;and
      discovered possibilities from which they recoiled. He took up his pen, and
      began a letter. &ldquo;To John Gallilee, Esquire: Dear Sir,&mdash;Circumstances
      have occurred, which I am not at liberty to mention, but which make it
      necessary for me, in justice to my own views and feelings, to withdraw
      from the position of legal adviser to yourself and family.&rdquo; He paused and
      considered with himself. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he decided; &ldquo;I may be of some use to that
      poor child, while I am the family lawyer.&rdquo; He tore up his unfinished
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Mool got home that night, it was noticed that he had a poor
      appetite for his dinner. On the other hand, he drank more wine than usual.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is the matter with me. Sometimes I think I am going to
      be really ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the day after Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s interview with her lawyer&mdash;and
      this was Carmina&rsquo;s answer, when the governess entered her room, after the
      lessons of the morning, and asked if she felt better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you still taking medicine?&rdquo; Miss Minerva inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Mr. Null says it&rsquo;s a tonic, and it&rsquo;s sure to do me good. It doesn&rsquo;t
      seem to have begun yet. I feel so dreadfully weak, Frances. The least
      thing makes me cry; and I put off doing what I ought to do, and want to
      do, without knowing why. You remember what I told you about Teresa? She
      may be with us in a few days more, for all I know to the contrary. I must
      find a nice lodging for her, poor dear&mdash;and here I am, thinking about
      it instead of doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me do it,&rdquo; Miss Minerva suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s sad face brightened. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind indeed!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I shall take the children out, after dinner to-day. Looking
      over lodgings will be an amusement to me and to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Zo? Why haven&rsquo;t you brought her with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is having her music lesson&mdash;and I must go back to keep her in
      order. About the lodging? A sitting-room and bedroom will be enough, I
      suppose? In this neighbourhood, I am afraid the terms will be rather
      high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind that! Let us have clean airy rooms&mdash;and a kind
      landlady. Teresa mustn&rsquo;t know it, if the terms are high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she allow you to pay her expenses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>you</i> put it delicately! My aunt seemed to doubt if Teresa had
      any money of her own. I forgot, at the time, that my father had left her a
      little income. She told me so herself, and wondered, poor dear, how she
      was to spend it all. She mustn&rsquo;t be allowed to spend it all. We will tell
      her that the terms are half what they may really be&mdash;and I will pay
      the other half. Isn&rsquo;t it cruel of my aunt not to let my old nurse live in
      the same house with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, a message arrived from one of the persons of whom she was
      speaking. Mrs. Gallilee wished to see Miss Carmina immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Miss Minerva, when the servant had withdrawn, &ldquo;why do you
      tremble so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in me, Frances, that shudders at my aunt, ever since&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva understood that sudden pause&mdash;the undesigned allusion to
      Carmina&rsquo;s guiltless knowledge of her feeling towards Ovid. By unexpressed
      consent, on either side, they still preserved their former relations as if
      Mrs. Gallilee had not spoken. Miss Minerva looked at Carmina sadly and
      kindly. &ldquo;Good-bye for the present!&rdquo; she said&mdash;and went upstairs again
      to the schoolroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall, Carmina found the servant waiting for her. He opened the
      library door. The learned lady was at her studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been speaking to Mr. Null about you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the previous evening, Carmina had kept her room. She had breakfasted in
      bed&mdash;and she now saw her aunt for the first time, since Mrs. Gallilee
      had left the house on her visit to Benjulia. The girl was instantly
      conscious of a change&mdash;to be felt rather than to be realised&mdash;a
      subtle change in her aunt&rsquo;s way of looking at her and speaking to her. Her
      heart beat fast. She took the nearest chair in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee proceeded, &ldquo;thinks it of importance to your
      health to be as much as possible in the air. He wishes you to drive out
      every day, while the fine weather lasts. I have ordered the open carriage
      to be ready, after luncheon. Other engagements will prevent me from
      accompanying you. You will be under the care of my maid, and you will be
      out for two hours. Mr. Null hopes you will gain strength. Is there
      anything you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you wish for a new dress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no complaint to make of the servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The servants are always kind to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t detain you any longer&mdash;I have a person coming to speak to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina had entered the room in doubt and fear. She left it with
      strangely-mingled feelings of perplexity and relief. Her sense of a
      mysterious change in her aunt had strengthened with every word that Mrs.
      Gallilee had said to her. She had heard of reformatory institutions, and
      of discreet persons called matrons who managed them. In her imaginary
      picture of such places, Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s tone and manner realised, in the
      strangest way, her idea of a matron speaking to a penitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she crossed the hall, her thoughts took a new direction. Some
      indefinable distrust of the coming time got possession of her. An ugly
      model of the Colosseum, in cork, stood on the hall table. She looked at it
      absently. &ldquo;I hope Teresa will come soon,&rdquo; she thought&mdash;and turned
      away to the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ascended slowly; her head drooping, her mind still preoccupied.
      Arrived at the first landing, a sound of footsteps disturbed her. She
      looked up&mdash;and found herself face to face with Mr. Le Frank, leaving
      the schoolroom after his music lesson. At that sudden discovery, a cry of
      alarm escaped her&mdash;the common little scream of a startled woman. Mr.
      Le Frank made an elaborately formal bow: he apologised with sternly stupid
      emphasis. &ldquo;I <i>beg</i> your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moved by a natural impulse, penitently conscious of those few foolish
      words of hers which he had so unfortunately overheard, the poor girl made
      an effort to conciliate him. &ldquo;I have very few friends, Mr. Le Frank,&rdquo; she
      said timidly. &ldquo;May I still consider you as one of them? Will you forgive
      and forget? Will you shake hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank made another magnificent bow. He was proud of his voice. In
      his most resonant and mellifluous tones, he said, &ldquo;You do me honour&mdash;&rdquo;
       and took the offered hand, and lifted it grandly, and touched it with his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held by the baluster with her free hand, and controlled the sickening
      sensation which that momentary contact with him produced. He might have
      detected the outward signs of the struggle, but for an interruption which
      preserved her from discovery. Mrs. Gallilee was standing at the open
      library door. Mrs. Gallilee said, &ldquo;I am waiting for you, Mr. Le Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina hurried up the stairs, pursued already by a sense of her own
      imprudence. In her first confusion and dismay, but one clear idea
      presented itself. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have I made another mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mrs. Gallilee had received her music-master with the nearest
      approach to an indulgent welcome, of which a hardened nature is capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the easy chair, Mr. Le Frank. You are not afraid of the open
      window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no! I like it.&rdquo; He rapidly unrolled some leaves of music which
      he had brought downstairs. &ldquo;With regard to the song that I had the honour
      of mentioning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee pointed to the table. &ldquo;Put the song there for the present. I
      have a word to say first. How came you to frighten my niece? I heard
      something like a scream, and naturally looked out. She was making an
      apology; she asked you to forgive and forget. What does all this mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank exhausted his ingenuity in efforts of polite evasion without
      the slightest success. From first to last (if the expression may be
      permitted) Mrs. Gallilee had him under her thumb. He was not released,
      until he had literally reported Carmina&rsquo;s opinion of him as a man and a
      musician, and had exactly described the circumstances under which he had
      heard it. Mrs. Gallilee listened with an interest, which (under less
      embarrassing circumstances) would have even satisfied Mrs. Le Frank&rsquo;s
      vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not for a moment deceived by the clumsy affectation of good humour
      with which he told his story. Her penetration discovered the vindictive
      feeling towards Carmina, which offered him, in case of necessity, as an
      instrument ready made to her hand. By fine degrees, she presented herself
      in the new character of a sympathising friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know now, Mr. Le Frank, why you declined to be my niece&rsquo;s music-master.
      Allow me to apologise for having ignorantly placed you in a false
      position. I appreciate the delicacy of your conduct&mdash;I understand,
      and admire you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s florid cheeks turned redder still. His cold blood began to
      simmer, heated by an all-pervading glow of flattered self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece&rsquo;s motives for concealment are plain enough,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee
      proceeded. &ldquo;Let me hope that she was ashamed to confess the total want of
      taste, delicacy, and good manners which has so justly offended you. Miss
      Minerva, however, has no excuse for keeping me in the dark. Her conduct,
      in this matter, offers, I regret to say, one more instance of her habitual
      neglect of the duties which attach to her position in my house. There
      seems to be some private understanding between my governess and my niece,
      of which I highly disapprove. However, the subject is too distasteful to
      dwell on. You were speaking of your song&mdash;the last effort of your
      genius, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His &ldquo;genius&rdquo;! The inner glow in Mr. Le Frank grew warmer and warmer. &ldquo;I
      asked for the honour of an interview,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;to make a request.&rdquo;
       He took up his leaves of music. &ldquo;This is my last, and, I hope, my best
      effort at composition. May I dedicate it&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me!&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee exclaimed with a burst of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank felt the compliment. He bowed gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need I say how gladly I accept the honour?&rdquo; With this gracious answer
      Mrs. Gallilee rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the change of position a hint, suggesting that Mr. Le Frank might
      leave her to her studies, now that his object was gained? Or was it an act
      of homage offered by Science to Art? Mr. Le Frank was incapable of placing
      an unfavourable interpretation on any position which a woman&mdash;and
      such a woman&mdash;could assume in his presence. He felt the compliment
      again. &ldquo;The first copy published shall be sent to you,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and
      snatched up his hat, eager to set the printers at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And five-and-twenty copies more, for which I subscribe,&rdquo; cried his
      munificent patroness, cordially shaking hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank attempted to express his sense of obligation. Generous Mrs.
      Gallilee refused to hear him. He took his leave; he got as far as the
      hall; and then he was called back&mdash;softly, confidentially called back
      to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thought has just struck me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;Please shut the door
      for a moment. About that meeting between you and my niece? Perhaps, I am
      taking a morbid view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Mr. Le Frank waited with breathless interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or is there something out of the common way, in that apology of hers?&rdquo;
       Mrs. Gallilee proceeded. &ldquo;Have you any idea what the motive might be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s ready suspicion was instantly aroused. &ldquo;Not the least
      idea,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Can you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as completely puzzled as you are,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank considered. His suspicions made an imaginative effort,
      assisted by his vanity. &ldquo;After my refusal to teach her,&rdquo; he suggested,
      &ldquo;that proposal to shake hands may have a meaning&mdash;&rdquo; There, his
      invention failed him. He stopped, and shook his head ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s object being attained, she made no attempt to help him.
      &ldquo;Perhaps, time will show,&rdquo; she answered discreetly. &ldquo;Good-bye again&mdash;with
      best wishes for the success of the song.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The solitude of her own room was no welcome refuge to Carmina, in her
      present state of mind. She went on to the schoolroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva was alone. The two girls, in obedience to domestic
      regulations, were making their midday toilet before dinner. Carmina
      described her interview with Mrs. Gallilee, and her meeting with Mr. Le
      Frank. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I make no excuse for my folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Le Frank had left the house, after you spoke to him,&rdquo; Miss Minerva
      answered, &ldquo;I should not have felt the anxiety which troubles me now. I
      don&rsquo;t like his going to Mrs. Gallilee afterwards&mdash;especially when you
      tell me of that change in her manner towards you. Yours is a vivid
      imagination, Carmina. Are you sure that it has not been playing you any
      tricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva was not quite satisfied. &ldquo;Will you help me to feel as certain
      about it as you do?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee generally looks in for a
      few minutes, while the children are at dinner. Stay here, and say
      something to her in my presence. I want to judge for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls came in. Maria&rsquo;s perfect toilet, reflected Maria&rsquo;s perfect
      character. She performed the duties of politeness with her usual happy
      choice of words. &ldquo;Dear Carmina, it is indeed a pleasure to see you again
      in our schoolroom. We are naturally anxious about your health. This lovely
      weather is no doubt in your favour; and papa thinks Mr. Null a remarkably
      clever man.&rdquo; Zo stood by frowning, while these smooth conventionalities
      trickled over her sister&rsquo;s lips. Carmina asked what was the matter. Zo
      looked gloomily at the dog on the rug. &ldquo;I wish I was Tinker,&rdquo; she said.
      Maria smiled sweetly. &ldquo;Dear Zoe, what a very strange wish! What would you
      do, if you were Tinker?&rdquo; The dog, hearing his name, rose and shook
      himself. Zo pointed to him, with an appearance of the deepest interest. <i>&ldquo;He</i>
      hasn&rsquo;t got to brush his hair, before he goes out for a walk; <i>his</i>
      nails don&rsquo;t took black when they&rsquo;re dirty. And, I say!&rdquo; (she whispered the
      next words in Carmina&rsquo;s ear) <i>&ldquo;he</i> hasn&rsquo;t got a governess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner made its appearance; and Mrs. Gallilee followed the dinner.
      Maria said grace. Zo, always ravenous at meals, forgot to say Amen.
      Carmina, standing behind her chair, prompted her. Zo said &ldquo;Amen; oh,
      bother!&rdquo; the first word at the top of her voice, and the last two in a
      whisper. Mrs. Gallilee looked at Carmina as she might have looked at an
      obtrusive person who had stepped in from the street. &ldquo;You had better dress
      before luncheon,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;or you will keep the carriage waiting.&rdquo;
       Hearing this, Zo laid down her knife and fork, and looked over her
      shoulder. &ldquo;Ask if I may go with you,&rdquo; she said. Carmina made the request.
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee answered, &ldquo;the children must walk. My maid will
      accompany you.&rdquo; Carmina glanced at Miss Minerva on leaving the room. The
      governess replied by a look. She too had seen the change in Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s manner, and was at a loss to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s maid Marceline belonged to a quick-tempered race: she was
      a Jersey woman. It is not easy to say which of the two felt most oppressed
      by their enforced companionship in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid was perhaps the most to be pitied. Secretly drawn towards Carmina
      like the other servants in the house, she was forced by her mistress&rsquo;s
      private instruction, to play the part of a spy. &ldquo;If the young lady changes
      the route which the coachman has my orders to take, or if she communicates
      with any person while your are out, you are to report it to me.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Gallilee had not forgotten the discovery of the travelling bag; and Mr.
      Mool&rsquo;s exposition of the law had informed her, that the superintendence of
      Carmina was as much a matter of serious pecuniary interest as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But recent events had, in one respect at least, improved the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ovid (as his mother actually ventured to hope!) broke off his
      engagement, when he heard the scandalous story of Carmina&rsquo;s birth, there
      was surely a chance that she, like other girls of her sensitive
      temperament, might feel the calamity that had fallen on her so acutely as
      to condemn herself to a single life. Misled, partly by the hope of relief
      from her own vile anxieties; partly by the heartless incapability of
      appreciating generous feeling in others, developed by the pursuits of her
      later life, Mrs. Gallilee seriously contemplated her son&rsquo;s future decision
      as a matter of reasonable doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, this detestable child of adultery&mdash;this living
      obstacle in the way of the magnificent prospects which otherwise awaited
      Maria and Zoe, to say nothing of their mother&mdash;must remain in the
      house, submitted to her guardian&rsquo;s authority, watched by her guardian&rsquo;s
      vigilance. The hateful creature was still entitled to medical attendance
      when she was ill, and must still be supplied with every remedy that the
      doctor&rsquo;s ingenuity could suggest. A liberal allowance was paid for the
      care of her; and the trustees were bound to interfere if it was not fairly
      earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking after the carriage as it drove away&mdash;Marceline on the front
      seat presenting the picture of discomfort; and Carmina opposite to her,
      unendurably pretty and interesting, with the last new poem on her lap&mdash;Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s reflections took their own bitter course. &ldquo;Accidents happen to
      other carriages, with other girls in them. Not to my carriage, with that
      girl in it! Nothing will frighten <i>my</i> horses to-day; and, fat as he
      is, <i>my</i> coachman will not have a fit on the box!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only too true. At the appointed hour the carriage appeared again&mdash;and
      (to complete the disappointment) Marceline had no report to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva had not forgotten her promise. When she returned from her
      walk with the children, the rooms had been taken. Teresa&rsquo;s London lodging
      was within five minutes&rsquo; walk of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, Carmina sent a telegram to Rome, on the chance that the
      nurse might not yet have begun her journey. The message (deferring other
      explanations until they met) merely informed her that her rooms were
      ready, adding the address and the landlady&rsquo;s name. Guessing in the dark,
      Carmina and the governess had ignorantly attributed the sinister
      alteration in Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s manner to the prospect of Teresa&rsquo;s unwelcome
      return. &ldquo;While you have the means in your power,&rdquo; Miss Minerva advised,
      &ldquo;it may be as well to let your old friend know that there is a home for
      her when she reaches London.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The weather, to Carmina&rsquo;s infinite relief, changed for the worse the next
      day. Incessant rain made it impossible to send her out in the carriage
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was an eventful day, nevertheless. On that rainy afternoon, Mr.
      Gallilee asserted himself as a free agent, in the terrible presence of his
      wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an uncommonly dull day, my dear,&rdquo; he began. This passed without
      notice, which was a great encouragement to go on. &ldquo;If you will allows me
      to say so, Carmina wants a little amusement.&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee looked up from
      her book. Fearing that he might stop altogether if he took his time as
      usual, Mr. Gallilee proceeded in a hurry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an afternoon
      performance of conjuring tricks; and, do you know, I really think I might
      take Carmina to see it. We shall be delighted if you will accompany us, my
      dear; and they do say&mdash;perhaps you have heard of it yourself?&mdash;that
      there&rsquo;s a good deal of science in this exhibition.&rdquo; His eyes rolled in
      uneasy expectation, as he waited to hear what his wife might decide. She
      waved her hand contemptuously in the direction of the door. Mr. Gallilee
      retired with the alacrity of a young man. &ldquo;Now we shall enjoy ourselves!&rdquo;
       he thought as he went up to Carmina&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just leaving the house, when the music-master arrived at the
      door to give his lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee immediately put his head out of the cab window. &ldquo;We are going
      to see the conjuring!&rdquo; he shouted cheerfully. &ldquo;Carmina! don&rsquo;t you see Mr.
      Le Frank? He is bowing to you. Do you like conjuring, Mr. Le Frank? Don&rsquo;t
      tell the children where we are going! They would be disappointed, poor
      things&mdash;but they must have their lessons, mustn&rsquo;t they? Good-bye! I
      say! stop a minute. If you ever want your umbrella mended, I know a man
      who will do it cheap and well. Nasty day, isn&rsquo;t it? Go on! go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general opinion which ranks vanity among the lighter failings of
      humanity, commits a serious mistake. Vanity wants nothing but the motive
      power to develop into absolute wickedness. Vanity can be savagely
      suspicious and diabolically cruel. What are the two typical names which
      stand revealed in history as the names of the two vainest men that ever
      lived? Nero and Robespierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his obscure sphere, and within his restricted means, the vanity of Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s music-master had developed its inherent qualities, under her
      cunning and guarded instigation. Once set in action, his suspicion of
      Carmina passed beyond all limits. There could be no reason but a bad
      reason for that barefaced attempt to entrap him into a reconciliation.
      Every evil motive which it was possible to attribute to a girl of her age,
      no matter how monstrously improbable it might be, occurred to him when he
      recalled her words, her look, and her manner at their meeting on the
      stairs. His paltry little mind, at other times preoccupied in
      contemplating himself and his abilities, was now so completely absorbed in
      imagining every variety of conspiracy against his social and professional
      position, that he was not even capable of giving his customary lesson to
      two children. Before the appointed hour had expired, Miss Minerva remarked
      that his mind did not appear to be at ease, and suggested that he had
      better renew the lesson on the next day. After a futile attempt to assume
      an appearance of tranquillity&mdash;he thanked her and took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way downstairs, he found the door of Carmina&rsquo;s room left half open.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was absent with Mr. Gallilee. Miss Minerva remained upstairs with the
      children. Mrs. Gallilee was engaged in scientific research. At that hour
      of the afternoon, there were no duties which called the servants to the
      upper part of the house. He listened&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;he went into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was possible that she might keep a journal: it was certain that she
      wrote and received letters. If he could only find her desk unlocked and
      her drawers open, the inmost secrets of her life would be at his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried her desk; he tried the cupboard under the bookcase. They were
      both locked. The cabinet between the windows and the drawer of the table
      were left unguarded. No discovery rewarded the careful search that he
      pursued in these two repositories. He opened the books that she had left
      on the table, and shook them. No forgotten letter, no private memorandum
      (used as marks) dropped out. He looked all round him; he peeped into the
      bedroom; he listened, to make sure that nobody was outside; he entered the
      bedroom, and examined the toilet-table, and opened the doors of the
      wardrobe&mdash;and still the search was fruitless, persevere as he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the sitting-room, he shook his fist at the writing-desk. &ldquo;You
      wouldn&rsquo;t be locked,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;unless you had some shameful secrets to
      keep! <i>I</i> shall have other opportunities; and <i>she</i> may not
      always remember to turn the key.&rdquo; He stole quietly down the stairs, and
      met no one on his way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bad weather continued on the next day. The object of Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s
      suspicion remained in the house&mdash;and the second opportunity failed to
      offer itself as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit to the exhibition of conjuring had done Carmina harm instead of
      good. Her head ached, in the close atmosphere&mdash;she was too fatigued
      to be able to stay in the room until the performance came to an end. Poor
      Mr. Gallilee retired in disgrace to the shelter of his club. At dinner,
      even his perfect temper failed him for the moment. He found fault with the
      champagne&mdash;and then apologised to the waiter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was a
      little hard on you just now. The fact is, I&rsquo;m out of sorts&mdash;you have
      felt in that way yourself, haven&rsquo;t you? The wine&rsquo;s first-rate; and, really
      the weather is so discouraging, I think I&rsquo;ll try another pint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Carmina&rsquo;s buoyant heart defied the languor of illness and the gloomy
      day. The post had brought her a letter from Ovid&mdash;enclosing a
      photograph, taken at Montreal, which presented him in his travelling
      costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote in a tone of cheerfulness, which revived Carmina&rsquo;s sinking
      courage, and renewed for a time at least the happiness of other days. The
      air of the plains of Canada he declared to be literally intoxicating.
      Every hour seemed to be giving him back the vital energy that he had lost
      in his London life. He slept on the ground, in the open air, more soundly
      than he had ever slept in a bed. But one anxiety troubled his mind. In the
      roving life which he now enjoyed, it was impossible that his letters could
      follow him&mdash;and yet, every day that passed made him more unreasonably
      eager to hear that Carmina was not weary of waiting for him, and that all
      was well at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how have these vain aspirations of mine ended?&rdquo;&mdash;the letter went
      on. &ldquo;They have ended, my darling, in a journey for one of my guides&mdash;an
      Indian, whose fidelity I have put to the proof, and whose zeal I have
      stimulated by a promise of reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Indian takes these lines to be posted at Quebec. He is also provided
      with an order, authorising my bankers to trust him with the letters that
      are waiting for me. I begin a canoe voyage to-morrow; and, after due
      consultation with the crew, we have arranged a date and a place at which
      my messenger will find me on his return. Shall I confess my own amiable
      weakness? or do you know me well enough already to suspect the truth? My
      love, I am sorely tempted to be false to my plans and arrangements to go
      back with the Indian to Quebec&mdash;and to take a berth in the first
      steamer that returns to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose that I am troubled by any misgivings about what is going on
      in my absence! It is one of the good signs of my returning health that I
      take the brightest view of our present lives, and of our lives to come. I
      feel tempted to go back, for the same reason that makes me anxious for
      letters. I want to hear from you, because I love you&mdash;I want to
      return at once, because I love you. There is longing, unutterable longing,
      in my heart. No doubts, my sweet one, and no fears!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was a doctor, before I became a lover. My medical knowledge tells
      me that this is an opportunity of thoroughly fortifying my constitution,
      and (with God&rsquo;s blessing) of securing to myself reserves of health and
      strength which will take us together happily on the way to old age. Dear
      love, you must be my wife&mdash;not my nurse! There is the thought that
      gives me self-denial enough to let the Indian go away by himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina answered this letter as soon as she had read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the mail could carry her reply to its destination, she well knew
      that the Indian messenger would be on the way back to his master. But Ovid
      had made her so happy that she felt the impulse to write to him at once,
      as she might have felt the impulse to answer him at once if he had been
      present and speaking to her. When the pages were filled, and the letter
      had been closed and addressed, the effort produced its depressing effect
      on her spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      There now appeared to her a certain wisdom in the loving rapidity of her
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the fullness of her joy, she was conscious of an underlying
      distrust of herself. Although he refused to admit it, Mr. Null had
      betrayed a want of faith in the remedy from which he had anticipated such
      speedy results, by writing another prescription. He had also added a glass
      to the daily allowance of wine, which he had thought sufficient thus far.
      Without despairing of herself, Carmina felt that she had done wisely in
      writing her answer, while she was still well enough to rival the cheerful
      tone of Ovid&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid down to rest on the sofa, with the photograph in her hand. No
      sense of loneliness oppressed her now; the portrait was the best of all
      companions. Outside, the heavy rain pattered; in the room, the busy clock
      ticked. She listened lazily, and looked at her lover, and kissed the
      faithful image of him&mdash;peacefully happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening of the door was the first little event that disturbed her. Zo
      peeped in. Her face was red, her hair was tousled, her fingers presented
      inky signs of a recent writing lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a rage,&rdquo; she announced; &ldquo;and so is the Other One.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina called her to the sofa, and tried to find out who this second
      angry person might be. &ldquo;Oh, you know!&rdquo; Zo answered doggedly. &ldquo;She rapped
      my knuckles. I call her a Beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! you mustn&rsquo;t talk in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here directly,&rdquo; Zo proceeded. &ldquo;You look out! She&rsquo;d rap <i>your</i>
      knuckles&mdash;only you&rsquo;re too big. If it wasn&rsquo;t raining, I&rsquo;d run away.&rdquo;
       Carmina assumed an air of severity, and entered a serious protest adapted
      to her young friend&rsquo;s intelligence. She might as well have spoken in a
      foreign language. Zo had another reason to give, besides the rap on the
      knuckles, for running away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; she resumed&mdash;&ldquo;you know the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boy, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes round sometimes. He&rsquo;s got a hurdy-gurdy. He&rsquo;s got a monkey. He
      grins. He says, <i>Aha&mdash;gimmee&mdash;haypenny.</i> I mean to go to
      that boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a confession of Zo&rsquo;s first love, this was irresistible. Carmina burst
      out laughing. Zo indignantly claimed a hearing. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done yet!&rdquo; she
      burst out. &ldquo;The boy dances. Like this.&rdquo; She cocked her head, and slapped
      her thigh, and imitated the boy. &ldquo;And sometimes he sings!&rdquo; she cried with
      another outburst of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Yah-yah-yah-bellah-vitah-yah!</i> That&rsquo;s Italian, Carmina.&rdquo; The door
      opened again while the performer was in full vigour&mdash;and Miss Minerva
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she entered the room, Carmina at once saw that Zo had correctly
      observed her governess. Miss Minerva&rsquo;s heavy eyebrows lowered; her lips
      were pale; her head was held angrily erect, &ldquo;Carmina!&rdquo; she said sharply,
      &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t encourage that child.&rdquo; She turned round, in search of the
      truant pupil. Incurably stupid at her lessons, Zo&rsquo;s mind had its gleams of
      intelligence, in a state of liberty. One of those gleams had shone
      propitiously, and had lighted her out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva took a chair: she dropped into it like a person worn out with
      fatigue. Carmina spoke to her gently. Words of sympathy were thrown away
      on that self-tormenting nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m not ill,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A night without sleep; a perverse child to
      teach in the morning; and a detestable temper at all times&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what is the matter with me.&rdquo; She looked at Carmina. &ldquo;You seem to be
      wonderfully better to-day. Has stupid Mr. Null really done you some good
      at last?&rdquo; She noticed the open writing-desk, and discovered the letter.
      &ldquo;Or is it good news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard from Ovid,&rdquo; Carmina answered. The photograph was still in
      her hand; but her inbred delicacy of feeling kept the portrait hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governess&rsquo;s sallow complexion turned little by little to a dull
      greyish white. Her hands, loosely clasped in her lap, tightened when she
      heard Ovid&rsquo;s name. That slight movement over, she stirred no more. After
      waiting a little, Carmina ventured to speak. &ldquo;Frances,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
      have not shaken hands with me yet.&rdquo; Miss Minerva slowly looked up, keeping
      her hands still clasped on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is he coming back?&rdquo; she asked. It was said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina quietly replied, &ldquo;Not yet&mdash;I am sorry to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of you, Frances, to say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: it&rsquo;s not good of me. I&rsquo;m thinking of myself&mdash;not of you.&rdquo; She
      suddenly lowered her tone. &ldquo;I wish you were married to him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Miss Minerva was the first to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will help me to understand,&rdquo; Carmina answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were married to him, even my restless spirit might be at peace.
      The struggle would be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left her chair, and walked restlessly up and down the room. The
      passionate emotion which she had resolutely suppressed began to get beyond
      her control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking about you last night,&rdquo; she abruptly resumed. &ldquo;You are a
      gentle little creature&mdash;but I have seen you show some spirit, when
      your aunt&rsquo;s cold-blooded insolence roused you. Do you know what I would
      do, if I were in your place? <i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t wait tamely till he came
      back to me&mdash;I would go to him. Carmina! Carmina! leave this horrible
      house!&rdquo; She stopped, close by the sofa. &ldquo;Let me look at you. Ha! I believe
      you have thought of it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say? You poor little prisoner, you <i>have</i> the right
      spirit in you! I wish I could give you some of my strength.&rdquo; The
      half-mocking tone in which she spoke, suddenly failed her. Her piercing
      eyes grew dim; the hard lines in her face softened. She dropped on her
      knees, and wound her lithe arms round Carmina, and kissed her. &ldquo;You sweet
      child!&rdquo; she said&mdash;and burst passionately into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then, the woman&rsquo;s fiercely self-dependent nature asserted itself. She
      pushed Carmina back on the sofa. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me! don&rsquo;t speak to me!&rdquo;
       she gasped. &ldquo;Leave me to get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stifled the sobs that broke from her. Still on her knees, she looked
      up, shuddering. A ghastly smile distorted her lips. &ldquo;Ah, what fools we
      are!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where is that lavender water, my dear&mdash;your
      favourite remedy for a burning head?&rdquo; She found the bottle before Carmina
      could help her, and soaked her handkerchief in the lavender water, and
      tied it round her head. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, as if they had been gossiping
      on the most commonplace subjects, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right: this is the best
      of all perfumes.&rdquo; She looked at the clock. &ldquo;The children&rsquo;s dinner will be
      ready in ten minutes. I must, and will, say what I have to say to you. It
      may be the last poor return I can make, Carmina, for all your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned to her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it if I frighten you,&rdquo; she resumed; &ldquo;I must tell you plainly
      that I don&rsquo;t like the prospect. In the first place, the sooner we two are
      parted&mdash;oh, only for a while!&mdash;the better for you. After what I
      went through, last night&mdash;no, I am not going to enter into any
      particulars; I am only going to repeat, what I have said already&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      trust me. I mean it, Carmina! Your generous nature shall not mislead you,
      if <i>I</i> can help it. When you are a happy married woman&mdash;when <i>he</i>
      is farther removed from me than he is even now&mdash;remember your ugly,
      ill-tempered friend, and let me come to you. Enough of this! I have other
      misgivings that are waiting to be confessed. You know that old nurse of
      yours intimately&mdash;while I only speak from a day or two&rsquo;s experience
      of her. To my judgment, she is a woman whose fondness for you might be
      turned into a tigerish fondness, on very small provocation. You write to
      her constantly. Does she know what you have suffered? Have you told her
      the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without reserve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely without reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When that old woman comes to London, Carmina&mdash;and sees you, and sees
      Mrs. Gallilee&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think the consequences may be serious? and
      your position between them something (if you were ten times stronger than
      you are) that no fortitude can endure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina started up on the sofa. She was not able to speak. Miss Minerva
      gave her time to recover herself&mdash;after another look at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not alarming you for nothing,&rdquo; she proceeded; &ldquo;I have something
      hopeful to propose. Your friend Teresa has energies&mdash;wild energies.
      Make a good use of them. She will do anything you ask or her. Take her
      with you to Canada!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Frances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva pointed to the letter on the desk. &ldquo;Does he tell you when he
      will be back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He feels the importance of completely restoring his health&mdash;he
      is going farther and farther away&mdash;he has sent to Quebec for his
      letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is no fear of your crossing each other on the voyage. Go to
      Quebec, and wait for him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should frighten him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you <i>must</i> say, if you are weak enough to wait for him here. Do
      you think his mother will consider his feelings, when he comes back to
      marry you? I tell you again I am not talking at random. I have thought it
      all out: I know how you can make your escape, and defy pursuit. You have
      plenty of money; you have Teresa to take care of you. Go! For your own
      sake, for his sake, go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck the hour. She rose and removed the handkerchief from her
      head. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Do I hear the rustling of a dress on the landing
      below?&rdquo; She snatched up a bottle of Mr. Null&rsquo;s medicine&mdash;as a reason
      for being in the room. The sound of the rustling dress came nearer and
      nearer. Mrs. Gallilee (on her way to the schoolroom dinner) opened the
      door. She instantly understood the purpose which the bottle was intended
      to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my business to give Carmina her medicine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your business
      is at the schoolroom table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took possession of the bottle, and advanced to Carmina. There were two
      looking-glasses in the room. One, in the usual position, over the
      fireplace; the other opposite, on the wall behind the sofa. Turning back,
      before she left the room, Miss Minerva saw Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s face, when she
      and Carmina looked at each other, reflected in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls were waiting for their dinner. Maria received the unpunctual
      governess with her ready smile, and her appropriate speech. &ldquo;Dear Miss
      Minerva, we were really almost getting alarmed about you. Pardon me for
      noticing it, you look&mdash;&rdquo; She caught the eye of the governess, and
      stopped confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Miss Minerva. &ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria still hesitated. Zo spoke out as usual. &ldquo;You look as if somebody had
      frightened you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      After two days of rain, the weather cleared again.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a calm, sunshiny Sunday morning. The flat country round Benjulia&rsquo;s
      house wore its brightest aspect on that clear autumn day. Even the
      doctor&rsquo;s gloomy domestic establishment reflected in some degree the change
      for the better. When he rose that morning, Benjulia presented himself to
      his household in a character which they were little accustomed to see&mdash;the
      character of a good-humoured master. He astonished his silent servant by
      attempting to whistle a tune. &ldquo;If you ever looked cheerful in your life,&rdquo;
       he said to the man, &ldquo;look cheerful now. I&rsquo;m going to take a holiday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After working incessantly&mdash;never leaving his laboratory; eating at
      his dreadful table; snatching an hour&rsquo;s rest occasionally on the floor&mdash;he
      had completed a series of experiments, with results on which he could
      absolutely rely. He had advanced by one step nearer towards solving that
      occult problem in brain disease, which had thus far baffled the
      investigations of medical men throughout the civilised world. If his
      present rate of progress continued, the lapse of another month might add
      his name to the names that remain immortal among physicians, in the Annals
      of Discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      So completely had his labours absorbed his mind that he only remembered
      the letters which Mrs. Gallilee had left with him, when he finished his
      breakfast on Sunday morning. Upon examination, there appeared no allusion
      in Ovid&rsquo;s correspondence to the mysterious case of illness which he had
      attended at Montreal. The one method now left, by which Benjulia could
      relieve the doubt that still troubled him, was to communicate directly
      with his friend in Canada. He decided to celebrate his holiday by taking a
      walk; his destination being the central telegraph office in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, before he left the house, his domestic duties claimed attention. He
      issued his orders to the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock he would return to dinner. That day was to witness the
      celebration of his first regular meat for forty-eight hours past; and he
      expected the strictest punctuality. The cook&mdash;lately engaged&mdash;was
      a vigourous little woman, with fiery hair and a high colour. She, like the
      man-servant, felt the genial influence of her master&rsquo;s amiability. He
      looked at her, for the first time since she had entered the house. A
      twinkling light showed itself furtively in his dreary gray eyes: he took a
      dusty old hand-screen from the sideboard, and made her a present of it!
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said with his dry humour, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t spoil your complexion before
      the kitchen fire.&rdquo; The cook possessed a sanguine temperament, and a taste
      to be honoured and encouraged&mdash;the taste for reading novels. She put
      her own romantic construction on the extraordinary compliment which the
      doctor&rsquo;s jesting humour had paid to her. As he walked out, grimly smiling
      and thumping his big stick on the floor, a new idea illuminated her mind.
      Her master admired her; her master was no ordinary man&mdash;it might end
      in his marrying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way to the telegraph office, Benjulia left Ovid&rsquo;s letters at Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had personally returned them, he would have found the learned lady
      in no very gracious humour. On the previous day she had discovered Carmina
      and Miss Minerva engaged in a private conference&mdash;without having been
      able even to guess what the subject under discussion between them might
      be. They were again together that morning. Maria and Zo had gone to church
      with their father; Miss Minerva was kept at home by a headache. At that
      hour, and under those circumstances, there was no plausible pretence which
      would justify Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s interference. She seriously contemplated the
      sacrifice of a month&rsquo;s salary, and the dismissal of her governess without
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the footman opened the door, Benjulia handed in the packet of
      letters. After his latest experience of Mrs. Gallilee, he had no intention
      of returning her visit. He walked away without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cable took his message to Mr. Morphew in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Ovid&rsquo;s
      patient at Montreal. Was the complaint brain disease? Yes or no.&rdquo; Having
      made arrangements for the forwarding of the reply from his club, he set
      forth on the walk back to his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five minutes to three, he was at home again. As the clock struck the
      hour, he rang the bell. The man-servant appeared, without the dinner.
      Benjulia&rsquo;s astonishing amiability&mdash;on his holiday&mdash;was even
      equal to this demand on its resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ordered roast mutton at three,&rdquo; he said, with terrifying tranquillity.
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dinner will be ready in ten minutes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it not ready now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cook hopes you will excuse her, sir. She is a little behindhand
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has hindered her, if you please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silent servant&mdash;on all other occasions the most impenetrable of
      human beings&mdash;began to tremble. The doctor had, literally, kicked a
      man out of the house who had tried to look through the laboratory
      skylight. He had turned away a female servant at half an hour&rsquo;s notice,
      for forgetting to shut the door, a second time in one day. But what were
      these highhanded proceedings, compared with the awful composure which,
      being kept waiting for dinner, only asked what had hindered the cook, and
      put the question politely, by saying, &ldquo;if you please&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you were making love to her?&rdquo; the doctor suggested, as gently as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This outrageous insinuation stung the silent servant into speech. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      incapable of the action, sir!&rdquo; he answered indignantly; &ldquo;the woman was
      reading a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia bent his head, as if in acknowledgment of a highly satisfactory
      explanation. &ldquo;Oh? reading a story? People who read stories are said to
      have excitable brains. Should you call the cook excitable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should, sir! Most cooks are excitable. They say it&rsquo;s the kitchen fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they? You can go now. Don&rsquo;t hurry the cook&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited, apparently following some new train of thought which highly
      diverted him. Ten minutes passed&mdash;then a quarter of an hour then
      another five minutes. When the servant returned with the dinner, the
      master&rsquo;s private reflections continued to amuse him: his thin lips were
      still widening grimly, distended by his formidable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      On being carved, the mutton proved to be underdone. At other times, this
      was an unpardonable crime in Benjulia&rsquo;s domestic code of laws. All he said
      now was, &ldquo;Take it away.&rdquo; He dined on potatoes, and bread and cheese. When
      he had done, he was rather more amiable than ever. He said, &ldquo;Ask the cook
      to come and see me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook presented herself, with one hand on her palpitating heart, and
      the other holding her handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you crying about?&rdquo; Benjulia inquired; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t scolded you,
      have I?&rdquo; The cook began an apology; the doctor pointed to a chair. &ldquo;Sit
      down, and recover yourself.&rdquo; The cook sat down, faintly smiling through
      her tears. This otherwise incomprehensible reception of a person who had
      kept the dinner waiting twenty minutes, and who had not done the mutton
      properly even then (taken in connection with the master&rsquo;s complimentary
      inquiries, reported downstairs by the footman), could bear but one
      interpretation. It wasn&rsquo;t every woman who had her beautiful hair, and her
      rosy complexion. Why had she not thought of going upstairs first, just to
      see whether she looked her best in the glass? Would he begin by making a
      confession? or would he begin by kissing her?
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by lighting his pipe. For a while he smoked placidly with his eye
      on the cook. &ldquo;I hear you have been reading a story,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;What is
      the name of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pamela; or Virtue Rewarded,&rsquo; sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia went on with his smoking. The cook, thus far demure and downcast,
      lifted her eyes experimentally. He was still looking at her. Did he want
      encouragement? The cook cautiously offered a little literary information,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The author&rsquo;s name is on the book, sir. Name of Richardson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The information was graciously received, &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve heard of the name, and
      heard of the book. Is it interesting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, it&rsquo;s a beautiful story! My only excuse for being late with the
      dinner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Pamela?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young person in service, sir. I&rsquo;m sure I wish I was more like her! I
      felt quite broken-hearted when you sent the mutton down again; and you so
      kind as to overlook the error in the roasting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia stopped the apology once more. He pursued his own ends with a
      penitent cook, just as he pursued his own ends with a vivisected animal.
      Nothing moved him out of his appointed course, in the one or in the other.
      He returned to Pamela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what becomes of her at the end of the story?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook simpered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Pamela who is the virtuous young person, sir. And
      so the story comes true&mdash;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who rewards her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was there ever anything so lucky as this? Pamela&rsquo;s situation was fast
      becoming the cook&rsquo;s situation. The bosom of the vigourous little woman
      began to show signs of tender agitation&mdash;distributed over a large
      surface. She rolled her eyes amorously. Benjulia puffed out another
      mouthful of smoke. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;who rewards Pamela?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her master, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook&rsquo;s eyes sank modestly to her lap. The cook&rsquo;s complexion became
      brighter than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her master marries her, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all he said. He was not astonished, or confused, or encouraged&mdash;he
      simply intimated that he now knew how Pamela&rsquo;s master had rewarded Pamela.
      And, more dispiriting still, he took the opportunity of knocking the ashes
      out of his pipe, and filled it, and lit it again. If the cook had been one
      of the few miserable wretches who never read novels, she might have felt
      her fondly founded hopes already sinking from under her. As it was,
      Richardson sustained her faith in herself; Richardson reminded her that
      Pamela&rsquo;s master had hesitated, and that Pamela&rsquo;s Virtue had not earned its
      reward on easy terms. She stole another look at the doctor. The eloquence
      of women&rsquo;s eyes, so widely and justly celebrated in poetry and prose, now
      spoke in the cook&rsquo;s eyes. They said, &ldquo;Marry me, dear sir, and you shall
      never have underdone mutton again.&rdquo; The hearts of other savages have been
      known to soften under sufficient influences&mdash;why should the
      scientific savage, under similar pressure, not melt a little too? The
      doctor took up the talk again: he made a kind allusion to the cook&rsquo;s
      family circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you first came here, I think you told me you had no relations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an orphan, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you had been some time out of a situation, when I engaged you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; my poor little savings were nearly at an end!&rdquo; Could he resist
      that pathetic picture of the orphan&rsquo;s little savings&mdash;framed, as it
      were, in a delicately-designed reference to her fellow-servant in the
      story? &ldquo;I was as poor as Pamela,&rdquo; she suggested softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as virtuous,&rdquo; Benjulia added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook&rsquo;s eloquent eyes said, &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid down his pipe. That was a good sign, surely? He drew his chair
      nearer to her. Better and better! His arm was long enough, in the new
      position, to reach her waist. Her waist was ready for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing in particular to do, this afternoon; and I have nothing
      particular to do.&rdquo; He delivered himself of this assertion rather abruptly.
      At the same time, it was one of those promising statements which pave the
      way for anything. He might say, &ldquo;Having nothing particular to do to-day&mdash;why
      shouldn&rsquo;t we make love?&rdquo; Or he might say, &ldquo;Having nothing particular to do
      to-morrow&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t we get the marriage license?&rdquo; Would he put
      it in that way? No: he made a proposal of quite another kind. He said,
      &ldquo;You seem to be fond of stories. Suppose I tell you a story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, there was some hidden meaning in this. There was unquestionably a
      sudden alteration in his look and manner; the cook asked herself what it
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had seen the doctor at his secret work in the laboratory, the
      change in him might have put her on her guard. He was now looking
      (experimentally) at the inferior creature seated before him in the chair,
      as he looked (experimentally) at the other inferior creatures stretched
      under him on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      His story began in the innocent, old-fashioned way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time, there was a master and there was a maid. We will call
      the master by the first letter of the alphabet&mdash;Mr. A. And we will
      call the maid by the second letter&mdash;Miss B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook drew a long breath of relief. There <i>was</i> a hidden meaning
      in the doctor&rsquo;s story. The unfortunate woman thought to herself, &ldquo;I have
      not only got fine hair and a beautiful complexion; I am clever as well!&rdquo;
       On her rare evenings of liberty, she sometimes gratified another highly
      creditable taste, besides the taste for reading novels. She was an eager
      play-goer. That notable figure in the drama&mdash;the man who tells his
      own story, under pretence of telling the story of another person&mdash;was
      no unfamiliar figure in her stage experience. Her encouraging smile made
      its modest appearance once more. In the very beginning of her master&rsquo;s
      story, she saw already the happy end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all of us have our troubles in life,&rdquo; Benjulia went on; &ldquo;and Miss B.
      had her troubles. For a long time, she was out of a situation; and she had
      no kind parents to help her. Miss B. was an orphan. Her little savings
      were almost gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too distressing. The cook took out her handkerchief, and pitied
      Miss B. with all her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But virtue, as we know when we read &lsquo;Pamela,&rsquo; is sure of its reward.
      Circumstances occurred in the household of Mr. A. which made it necessary
      for him to engage a cook. He discovered an advertisement in a newspaper,
      which informed him that Miss B. was in search of a situation. Mr. A. found
      her to be a young and charming woman. Mr. A. engaged her.&rdquo; At that
      critical part of the story, Benjulia paused. &ldquo;And what did Mr. A. do
      next?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook could restrain herself no longer. She jumped out of her chair,
      and threw her arms round the doctor&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia went on with his story as if nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did Mr. A. do next?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;He put his hand in his pocket&mdash;he
      gave Miss B. a month&rsquo;s wages&mdash;and he turned her out of the house. You
      impudent hussy, you have delayed my dinner, spoilt my mutton, and hugged
      me round the neck! There is your money. Go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With glaring eyes and gaping mouth, the cook stood looking at him, like a
      woman struck to stone. In a moment more, the rage burst out of her in a
      furious scream. She turned to the table, and snatched up a knife. Benjulia
      wrenched it from her hand, and dropped back into his chair completely
      overpowered by the success of his little joke. He did what he had never
      done within the memory of his oldest friend&mdash;he burst out laughing.
      &ldquo;This <i>has</i> been a holiday!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t I got somebody
      with me to enjoy it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that laugh, at those words, the cook&rsquo;s fury in its fiercest heat became
      frozen by terror. There was something superhuman in the doctor&rsquo;s
      diabolical joy. Even <i>he</i> felt the wild horror in the woman&rsquo;s eyes as
      they rested on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; he asked. She muttered and mumbled&mdash;and,
      shrinking away from him, crept towards the door. As she approached the
      window, a man outside passed by it on his way to the house. She pointed to
      him; and repeated Benjulia&rsquo;s own words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody to enjoy it with you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the dining-room door. The man-servant appeared in the hall,
      with a gentleman behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman was a scrupulously polite person. He looked with alarm at
      the ghastly face of the cook as she ran past him, making for the kitchen
      stairs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I intrude on you at an unfortunate time,&rdquo; he said to
      Benjulia. &ldquo;Pray excuse me; I will call again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, sir.&rdquo; The doctor spoke absently, looking towards the hall, and
      thinking of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Mool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have had the honour of meeting you at one
      of Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. I don&rsquo;t remember it myself. Take a seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still thinking of something else. Modest Mr. Mool took a seat in
      confusion. The doctor crossed the room, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me for a minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will be back directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the top of the kitchen stairs, and called to the housemaid. &ldquo;Is
      the cook down there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crying her heart out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia turned away again with the air of a disappointed man. A violent
      moral shock sometimes has a serious effect on the brain&mdash;especially
      when it is the brain of an excitable woman. Always a physiologist, even in
      those rare moments when he was amusing himself, it had just struck
      Benjulia that the cook&mdash;after her outbreak of fury&mdash;might be a
      case worth studying. But, she had got relief in crying; her brain was
      safe; she had ceased to interest him. He returned to the dining-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;You look hot, sir; have a drink. Old English ale, out of the barrel.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      The tone was hearty. He poured out the sparkling ale into a big tumbler,
      with hospitable good-will. Mr. Mool was completely, and most agreeably,
      taken by surprise. He too was feeling the influence of the doctor&rsquo;s good
      humour&mdash;enriched in quality by pleasant remembrances of his interview
      with the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live in the suburbs, Doctor Benjulia, on this side of London,&rdquo; Mr. Mool
      explained; &ldquo;and I have had a nice walk from my house to yours. If I have
      done wrong, sir, in visiting you on Sunday, I can only plead that I am
      engaged in business during the week&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. One day&rsquo;s the same as another, provided you don&rsquo;t interrupt
      me. You don&rsquo;t interrupt me now. Do you smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind my smoking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very amiable on your part, I&rsquo;m sure. What did you say your name was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia looked at him suspiciously. Was he a physiologist, and a rival?
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a doctor&mdash;are you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the few popular prejudices which Benjulia shared with his inferior
      fellow-creatures was the prejudice against lawyers. But for his angry
      recollection of the provocation successfully offered to him by his
      despicable brother, Mrs. Gallilee would never have found her way into his
      confidence. But for his hearty enjoyment of the mystification of the cook,
      Mr. Mool would have been requested to state the object of his visit in
      writing, and would have gone home again a baffled man. The doctor&rsquo;s
      holiday amiability had reached its full development indeed, when he
      allowed a strange lawyer to sit and talk with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of your profession,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;never pay visits to people
      whom they don&rsquo;t know, without having their own interests in view. Mr.
      Mool, you want something of me. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool&rsquo;s professional tact warned him to waste no time on prefatory
      phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I venture on my present intrusion,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;in consequence of a
      statement recently made to me, in my office, by Mrs. Gallilee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Benjulia. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like your beginning, I can tell you. Is
      it necessary to mention the name of that old&mdash;?&rdquo; He used a word,
      described in dictionaries as having a twofold meaning. (First, &ldquo;A female
      of the canine kind.&rdquo; Second, &ldquo;A term of reproach for a woman.&rdquo;) It shocked
      Mr. Mool; and it is therefore unfit to be reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Doctor Benjulia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that mean that you positively must talk about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool smiled. &ldquo;Let us say that it may bear that meaning,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, then&mdash;and get it over. She made a statement in your office.
      Out with it, my good fellow. Has it anything to do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not otherwise, Doctor Benjulia, have ventured to present myself
      at your house.&rdquo; With that necessary explanation, Mr. Mool related all that
      had passed between Mrs. Gallilee and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outset of the narrative, Benjulia angrily laid aside his pipe, on
      the point of interrupting the lawyer. He changed his mind; and, putting a
      strong constraint on himself, listened in silence. &ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Mool
      concluded, &ldquo;you will not take a hard view of my motive. It is only the
      truth to say that I am interested in Miss Carmina&rsquo;s welfare. I felt the
      sincerest respect and affection for her parents. You knew them too. They
      were good people. On reflection you must surely regret it, if you have
      carelessly repeated a false report? Won&rsquo;t you help me to clear the poor
      mother&rsquo;s memory of this horrid stain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia smoked in silence. Had that simple and touching appeal found its
      way to him? He began very strangely, when he consented at last to open his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re what they call, a middle-aged man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose you have
      had some experience of women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool blushed. &ldquo;I am a married man, sir,&rdquo; he replied gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; that&rsquo;s experience&mdash;of one kind. When a man&rsquo;s out of
      temper, and a woman wants something of him, do you know how cleverly she
      can take advantage of her privileges to aggravate him, till there&rsquo;s
      nothing he won&rsquo;t do to get her to leave him in peace? That&rsquo;s how I came to
      tell Mrs. Gallilee, what she told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited a little, and comforted himself with his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind this,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t profess to feel any interest in the
      girl; and I never cared two straws about her parents. At the same time, if
      you can turn to good account what I am going to say next&mdash;do it, and
      welcome. This scandal began in the bragging of a fellow-student of mine at
      Rome. He was angry with me, and angry with another man, for laughing at
      him when he declared himself to be Mrs. Robert Graywell&rsquo;s lover: and he
      laid us a wager that we should see the woman alone in his room, that
      night. We were hidden behind a curtain, and we did see her in his room. I
      paid the money I had lost, and left Rome soon afterwards. The other man
      refused to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what ground?&rdquo; Mr. Mool eagerly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the ground that she wore a thick veil, and never showed her face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unanswerable objection, Doctor Benjulia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it might be. I didn&rsquo;t think so myself. Two hours before, Mrs.
      Robert Graywell and I had met in the street. She had on a dress of a
      remarkable colour in those days&mdash;a sort of sea-green. And a bonnet to
      match, which everybody stared at, because it was not half the size of the
      big bonnets then in fashion. There was no mistaking the strange dress or
      the tall figure, when I saw her again in the student&rsquo;s room. So I paid the
      bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the name of the man who refused to pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name was Egisto Baccani.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard anything of him since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He got into some political scrape, and took refuge, like the rest of
      them, in England; and got his living, like the rest of them, by teaching
      languages. He sent me his prospectus&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I came to know about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the prospectus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Torn up, long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool wrote down the name in his pocket-book. &ldquo;There is nothing more
      you can tell me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept my best thanks, doctor. Good-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you find Baccani let me know. Another drop of ale? Are you likely to
      see Mrs. Gallilee soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if I find Baccani.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever play with children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have five of my own to play with,&rdquo; Mr. Mool answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Ask for the youngest child when you go to Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s. We
      call her Zo. Put your finger on her spine&mdash;here, just below the neck.
      Press on the place&mdash;so. And, when she wriggles, say, With the big
      doctor&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Getting back to his own house, Mr. Mool was surprised to find an open
      carriage at the garden gate. A smartly-dressed woman, on the front seat,
      surveyed him with an uneasy look. &ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;would
      you kindly tell Miss Carmina that we really mustn&rsquo;t wait any longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s uneasiness was reflected in Mr. Mool&rsquo;s face. A visit from
      Carmina, at his private residence, could have no ordinary motive. The fear
      instantly occurred to him that Mrs. Gallilee might have spoken to her of
      her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he opened the drawing-room door, this alarm passed away. He heard
      Carmina talking with his wife and daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I say one little word to you, Mr. Mool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her into his study. She was shy and confused, but certainly
      neither angry nor distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt sends me out every day, when it&rsquo;s fine, for a drive,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;As the carriage passed close by, I thought I might ask you a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my dear! As many questions as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the law. My aunt says she has the authority over me now, which
      my dear father had while he was living. Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long is she my guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you are twenty-one years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faint colour faded from Carmina&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;More than three years perhaps
      to suffer!&rdquo; she said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To suffer? What do you mean, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned paler still, and made no reply. &ldquo;I want to ask one thing more?&rdquo;
       she resumed, in sinking tones. &ldquo;Would my aunt still be my guardian&mdash;supposing
      I was married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool answered this, with his eyes fixed on her in grave scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, your husband is the only person who has any authority over
      you. These are rather strange questions, Carmina. Won&rsquo;t you take me into
      your confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In sudden agitation she seized his hand and kissed it. &ldquo;I must go!&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I have kept the carriage waiting too long already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran out, without once looking back.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s maid looked at her watch, when the carriage left Mr.
      Mool&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;We shall be nearly an hour late, before we get home,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault, Marceline. Tell your mistress the truth, if she questions
      you. I shall not think the worse of you for obeying your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather lose my place, Miss, than get you into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman spoke truly, Carmina&rsquo;s sweet temper had made her position not
      only endurable, but delightful: she had been treated like a companion and
      a friend. But for that circumstance&mdash;so keenly had Marceline felt the
      degradation of being employed as a spy&mdash;she would undoubtedly have
      quitted Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s service.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home, instead of talking pleasantly as usual, Carmina was
      silent and sad. Had this change in her spirits been caused by the visit to
      Mr. Mool? It was even so. The lawyer had innocently decided her on taking
      the desperate course which Miss Minerva had proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s assertion of her absolute right of authority, as
      guardian, had been declared by Mr. Mool to be incorrect, Carmina
      (hopefully forgetful of her aunt&rsquo;s temper) had thought of a compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have consented to remain at Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s disposal until Ovid
      returned, on condition of being allowed, when Teresa arrived in London, to
      live in retirement with her old nurse. This change of abode would prevent
      any collision between Mrs. Gallilee and Teresa, and would make Carmina&rsquo;s
      life as peaceful, and even as happy, as she could wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now that the lawyer had confirmed her aunt&rsquo;s statement of the position
      in which they stood towards one another, instant flight to Ovid&rsquo;s love and
      protection seemed to be the one choice left&mdash;unless Carmina could
      resign herself to a life of merciless persecution and perpetual suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangements for the flight were already complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      That momentary view of Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s face, reflected in the glass, had
      confirmed Miss Minerva&rsquo;s resolution to interfere. Closeted with Carmina on
      the Sunday morning, she had proposed a scheme of escape, which would even
      set Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s vigilance and cunning at defiance. No pecuniary
      obstacle stood in the way. The first quarterly payment of Carmina&rsquo;s
      allowance of five hundred a year had been already made, by Mool&rsquo;s advice.
      Enough was left&mdash;even without the assistance which the nurse&rsquo;s
      resources would render&mdash;to purchase the necessary outfit, and to take
      the two women to Quebec. On the day after Teresa&rsquo;s arrival (at an hour of
      the morning while the servants were still in bed) Carmina and her
      companion could escape from the house on foot&mdash;and not leave a trace
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Fortune befriended Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s maid. No questions were put
      to her; no notice even was taken of the late return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes before the carriage drew up at the house, a learned female
      friend from the country called, by appointment, on Mrs. Gallilee. On the
      coming Tuesday afternoon, an event of the deepest scientific interest was
      to take place. A new Professor had undertaken to deliver himself, by means
      of a lecture, of subversive opinions on &ldquo;Matter.&rdquo; A general discussion was
      to follow; and in that discussion (upon certain conditions) Mrs. Gallilee
      herself proposed to take part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Professor attempts to account for the mutual action of separate
      atoms,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I defy him to do it, without assuming the existence of
      a continuous material medium in space. And this point of view being
      accepted&mdash;follow me here! what is the result? In plain words,&rdquo; cried
      Mrs. Gallilee, rising excitedly to her feet, &ldquo;we dispense with the idea of
      atoms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friend looked infinitely relieved by the prospect of dispensing with
      atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now observe!&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee proceeded. &ldquo;In connection with this part of
      the subject, I shall wait to see if the Professor adopts Thomson&rsquo;s theory.
      You are acquainted with Thomson&rsquo;s theory? No? Let me put it briefly. Mere
      heterogeneity, together with gravitation, is sufficient to explain all the
      apparently discordant laws of molecular action. You understand? Very well.
      If the Professor passes over Thomson, <i>then,</i> I rise in the body of
      the Hall, and take my stand&mdash;follow me again!&mdash;on these
      grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s grounds were being laid out for the benefit of her
      friend, the coachman took the carriage back to the stables; the maid went
      downstairs to tea; and Carmina joined Miss Minerva in the schoolroom&mdash;all
      three being protected from discovery, by Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s rehearsal of her
      performance in the Comedy of Atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Monday morning brought with it news from Rome&mdash;serious news which
      confirmed Miss Minerva&rsquo;s misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina received a letter, bearing the Italian postmark, but not addressed
      to her in Teresa&rsquo;s handwriting. She looked to the signature before she
      began to read. Her correspondent was the old priest&mdash;Father Patrizio.
      He wrote in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&mdash;Our good Teresa leaves us to-day, on her journey to
      London. She has impatiently submitted to the legal ceremonies, rendered
      necessary by her husband having died without making a will. He hardly left
      anything in the way of money, after payment of his burial expenses, and
      his few little debts. What is of far greater importance&mdash;he lived,
      and died, a good Christian. I was with him in his last moments. Offer your
      prayers, my dear, for the repose of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teresa left me, declaring her purpose of travelling night and day, so as
      to reach you the sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her headlong haste, she has not even waited to look over her husband&rsquo;s
      papers; but has taken the case containing them to England&mdash;to be
      examined at leisure, in your beloved company. Strong as this good creature
      is, I believe she will be obliged to rest on the road for a night at
      least. Calculating on this, I assume that my letter will get to you first.
      I have something to say about your old nurse, which it is well that you
      should know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not for a moment suppose that I blame you for having told Teresa of
      the unfriendly reception, which you appear to have met with from your aunt
      and guardian. Who should you confide in&mdash;if not in the excellent
      woman who has filled the place of a mother to you? Besides, from your
      earliest years, have I not always instilled into you the reverence of
      truth? You have told the truth in your letters. My child, I commend you,
      and feel for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the impression produced on Teresa is not what you or I could wish. It
      is one of her merits, that she loves you with the truest devotion; it is
      one of her defects, that she is fierce and obstinate in resentment. Your
      aunt has become an object of absolute hatred to her. I have combated
      successfully, as I hope and believe&mdash;this unchristian state of
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is now beyond the reach of my influence. My purpose in writing is to
      beg you to continue the good work that I have begun. Compose this
      impetuous nature; restrain this fiery spirit. Your gentle influence,
      Carmina, has a power of its own over those who love you&mdash;and who
      loves you like Teresa?&mdash;of which perhaps you are not yourself aware.
      Use your power discreetly; and, with the blessing of God and his Saints, I
      have no fear of the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write to me, my child, when Teresa arrives&mdash;and let me hear that you
      are happier, and better in health. Tell me also, whether there is any
      speedy prospect of your marriage. If I may presume to judge from the
      little I know, your dearest earthly interests depend on the removal of
      obstacles to this salutary change in your life. I send you my good wishes,
      and my blessing. If a poor old priest like me can be of any service, do
      not forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FATHER PATRIZIO.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any lingering hesitation that Carmina might still have felt, was at an end
      when she read this letter. Good Father Patrizio, like good Mr. Mool, had
      innocently urged her to set her guardian&rsquo;s authority at defiance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the morning lessons were over, Carmina showed the priest&rsquo;s letter to
      Miss Minerva. The governess read it, and handed it back in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to say?&rdquo; Carmina asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. You know my opinion already. That letter says what I have said&mdash;with
      greater authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has determined me to follow your advice, Frances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it has done well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see,&rdquo; Carmina continued, &ldquo;that Father Patrizio speaks of
      obstacles in the way of my marriage. Teresa has evidently shown him my
      letters. Do you think he fears, as I do, that my aunt may find some means
      of separating us, even when Ovid comes back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in faint weary tones&mdash;listlessly leaning back in her chair.
      Carmina asked if she had passed another sleepless night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;another bad night, and the usual martyrdom in teaching
      the children. I don&rsquo;t know which disgusts me most&mdash;Zoe&rsquo;s impudent
      stupidity, or Maria&rsquo;s unendurable humbug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never yet spoken of Maria in this way. Even her voice seemed to be
      changed. Instead of betraying the usual angry abruptness, her tones coldly
      indicated impenetrable contempt. In the silence that ensued, she looked
      up, and saw Carmina&rsquo;s eyes resting on her anxiously and kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other human being but you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;would find me disagreeable and
      rude&mdash;and would be quite right, too. I haven&rsquo;t asked after your
      health. You look paler than usual. Have you, too, had a bad night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fell asleep towards the morning. And&mdash;oh, I had such a delightful
      dream! I could almost wish that I had never awakened from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did you dream of?&rdquo; She put the question mechanically&mdash;frowning,
      as if at some repellent thought suggested to her by what she had just
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dreamed of my mother,&rdquo; Carmina answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva raised herself at once in the chair. Whatever that passing
      impression might have been, she was free from it now. There was some
      little life again in her eyes; some little spirit in her voice. &ldquo;Take me
      out of myself,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;tell me your dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing very remarkable, Frances. We all of us sometimes see our
      dear lost ones in sleep. I saw my mother again, as I used to see her in
      the nursery at bedtime&mdash;tall and beautiful, with her long dark hair
      failing over her white dressing-gown to the waist. She stooped over me,
      and kissed me; and she looked surprised. She said, &lsquo;My little angel, why
      are you here in a strange house? I have come to take you back to your own
      cot, by my bedside.&rsquo; I wasn&rsquo;t surprised or frightened; I put my arms round
      her neck; and we floated away together through the cool starry night; and
      we were at home again. I saw my cot, with its pretty white curtains and
      pink ribbons. I heard my mother tell me an English fairy story, out of a
      book which my father had given to her&mdash;and her kind voice grew
      fainter and fainter, while I grew more and more sleepy&mdash;and it ended
      softly, just as it used to end in the happy old days. And I woke, crying.
      Do you ever dream of your mother now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? God forbid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Frances, what a dreadful thing to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? It was the thought in me, when you spoke. And with good reason,
      too. I was the last of a large family&mdash;the ugly one; the ill-tempered
      one; the encumbrance that made it harder than ever to find money enough to
      pay the household expenses. My father swore at my mother for being my
      mother. She reviled him just as bitterly in return; and vented the rest of
      her ill-temper on my wretched little body, with no sparing hand. Bedtime
      was her time for beating me. Talk of your mother&mdash;not of mine! You
      were very young, were you not, when she died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too young to feel my misfortune&mdash;but old enough to remember the
      sweetest woman that ever lived. Let me show you my father&rsquo;s portrait of
      her again. Doesn&rsquo;t that face tell you what an angel she was? There was
      some charm in her that all children felt. I can just remember some of my
      playfellows who used to come to our garden. Other good mothers were with
      us&mdash;but the children all crowded round <i>my</i> mother. They would
      have her in all their games; they fought for places on her lap when she
      told them stories; some of them cried, and some of them screamed, when it
      was time to take them away from her. Oh, why do we live! why do we die! I
      have bitter thoughts sometimes, Frances, like you. I have read in poetry
      that death is a fearful thing. To me, death is a cruel thing,&mdash;and it
      has never seemed so cruel as in these later days, since I have known Ovid.
      If my mother had but lived till now, what happiness would have been added
      to my life and to hers! How Ovid would have loved her&mdash;how she would
      have loved Ovid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva listened in silence. It was the silence of true interest and
      sympathy, while Carmina was speaking of her mother. When her lover&rsquo;s name
      became mingled with the remembrances of her childhood&mdash;the change
      came. Once more, the tell-tale lines began to harden in the governess&rsquo;s
      face. She lay back again in her chair. Her fingers irritably platted and
      unplatted the edge of her black apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina was too deeply absorbed in her thoughts, too eagerly bent on
      giving them expression, to notice these warning signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have all my mother&rsquo;s letters to my father,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;when he was
      away from her on his sketching excursions, You have still a little time to
      spare&mdash;I should so like to read some of them to you. I was reading
      one, last night&mdash;which perhaps accounts for my dream? It is on a
      subject that interests everybody. In my father&rsquo;s absence, a very dear
      friend of his met with a misfortune; and my mother had to prepare his wife
      to hear the bad news&mdash;oh, that reminds me! There is something I want
      to say to you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About yourself?&rdquo; Miss Minerva asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Ovid. I want your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva was silent. Carmina went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about writing to Ovid,&rdquo;
       she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply was suddenly and sharply given. &ldquo;Surely, I have not offended
      you?&rdquo; Carmina said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Let me hear your mother&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but I want you to hear the circumstances first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have mentioned them already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no! I mean the circumstances, in my case.&rdquo; She drew her chair closer
      to Miss Minerva. &ldquo;I want to whisper&mdash;for fear of somebody passing on
      the stairs. The more I think of it, the more I feel that I ought to
      prepare Ovid for seeing me, before I make my escape. You said when we
      talked of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I do mind! You said I could go to Ovid&rsquo;s bankers at Quebec, and
      then write when I knew where he was. I have been thinking over it since&mdash;and
      I see a serious risk. He might return from his inland journey, on the very
      day that I get there; he might even meet me in the street. In his delicate
      health&mdash;I daren&rsquo;t think of what the consequences of such a surprise
      might be! And then there is the dreadful necessity of telling him, that
      his mother has driven me into taking this desperate step. In my place,
      wouldn&rsquo;t you feel that you could do it more delicately in writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might write to-morrow, for instance. To-morrow is one of the American
      mail days. My letter would get to Canada (remembering the roundabout way
      by which Teresa and I are to travel, for fear of discovery), days and days
      before we could arrive. I should shut myself up in an hotel at Quebec; and
      Teresa could go every day to the bank, to hear if Ovid was likely to send
      for his letters, or likely to call soon and ask for them. Then he would be
      prepared. Then, when we meet&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governess left her chair, and pointed to the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina looked at her&mdash;and rose in alarm. &ldquo;Are you in pain?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;neuralgia, I think. I have the remedy in my room. Don&rsquo;t keep
      me, my dear. Mrs. Gallilee mustn&rsquo;t find me here again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paroxysm of pain which Carmina had noticed, passed over her face once
      more. She subdued it, and left the room. The pain mastered her again; a
      low cry broke from her when she closed the door. Carmina ran out:
      &ldquo;Frances! what is it?&rdquo; Frances looked over her shoulder, while she slowly
      ascended the stairs. &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I have got my
      remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina advanced a step to follow her, and drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that expression of suffering really caused by pain of the body? or was
      it attributable to anything that she had rashly said? She tried to recall
      what had passed between Frances and herself. The effort wearied her. Her
      thoughts turned self-reproachfully to Ovid. If <i>he</i> had been speaking
      to a friend whose secret sorrow was known to him, would he have mentioned
      the name of the woman whom they both loved? She looked at his portrait,
      and reviled herself as a selfish insensible wretch. &ldquo;Will Ovid improve
      me?&rdquo; she wondered. &ldquo;Shall I be a little worthier of him, when I am his
      wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon time came; and Mrs. Gallilee sent word that they were not to wait
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s studying,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallilee, with awe-struck looks. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going
      to make a speech at the Discussion to-morrow. The man who gives the
      lecture is the man she&rsquo;s going to pitch into. I don&rsquo;t know him; but how do
      you feel about it yourself, Carmina?&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t stand in his shoes
      for any sum of money you could offer me. Poor devil! I beg your pardon, my
      dear; let me give you a wing of the fowl. Boiled fowl&mdash;eh? and tongue&mdash;ha?
      Do you know the story of the foreigner? He dined out fifteen times with
      his English friends. And there was boiled fowl and tongue at every dinner.
      The fifteenth time, the foreigner couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. He slapped
      his forehead, and he said, &lsquo;Ah, merciful Heaven, cock and bacon again!&rsquo; 
      You won&rsquo;t mention it, will you?&mdash;and perhaps you think as I do?&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      sick of cock and bacon, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null&rsquo;s medical orders still prescribed fresh air. The carriage came to
      the door at the regular hour; and Mr. Gallilee, with equal regularity,
      withdrew to his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina was too uneasy to leave the house, without seeing Miss Minerva
      first. She went up to the schoolroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sound of voices, when she opened the door. Miss Minerva was
      writing, and silence had been proclaimed. The girls were ready dressed for
      their walk. Industrious Maria had her book. Idle Zo, perched on a high
      chair, sat kicking her legs. &ldquo;If you say a word,&rdquo; she whispered, as
      Carmina passed her, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be called an Imp, and stuck up on a chair. I
      shall go to the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you better, Frances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face denied it; the look of suffering was there still. She tore up the
      letter which she had been writing, and threw the fragments into the
      waste-paper basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the second letter you&rsquo;ve torn up,&rdquo; Zo remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say a word more&mdash;and you shall have bread and water for tea!&rdquo; Miss
      Minerva was not free from irritation, although she might be free from
      pain. Even Zo noticed how angry the governess was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could drive with me in the carriage,&rdquo; said Carmina. &ldquo;The air
      would do you so much good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! But you may soothe my irritable nerves in another way, if you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relieve me of these girls. Take them out with you. Do you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo instantly jumped off her chair; and even Maria looked up from her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take them with pleasure. Must we ask my aunt&rsquo;s permission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will dispense with your aunt&rsquo;s permission. She is shut up in her study&mdash;and
      we are all forbidden to disturb her. I will take it on myself.&rdquo; She turned
      to the girls with another outbreak of irritability. &ldquo;Be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria rose with dignity, and made one of her successful exits. &ldquo;I am
      sorry, dear Miss Minerva, if <i>I</i> have done anything to make you
      angry.&rdquo; She pointed the emphasis on &ldquo;I,&rdquo; by a side-look at her sister. Zo
      bounced out of the room, and performed the Italian boy&rsquo;s dance on the
      landing. &ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; said Maria. Zo burst into singing. <i>&ldquo;Yah
      yah-yah-bellah-vitah-yah!</i> Jolly! jolly! jolly!&mdash;we are going out
      for a drive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina waited, to say a friendly word, before she followed the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think me neglectful, Frances, when I let you go upstairs by
      yourself!&rdquo; Miss Minerva answered sadly and kindly. &ldquo;The best thing you
      could do was to leave me by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s mind was still not quite at ease. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but you were in
      pain,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You curious child! I am not in pain now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you make me comfortable, Frances? Give me a kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two, my dear&mdash;if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed Carmina on one cheek and on the other. &ldquo;Now leave me to write,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive ought to have been a pleasant one, with Zo in the carriage. To
      Marceline, it was a time of the heartiest enjoyment. Maria herself
      condescended to smile, now and then. There was only one dull person among
      them. &ldquo;Miss Carmina was but poor company,&rdquo; the maid remarked when they got
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee herself received them in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never take the children out again without my leave,&rdquo; she said to
      Carmina. &ldquo;The person who is really responsible for what you have done,
      will mislead you no more.&rdquo; With those words she entered the library, and
      closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria and Zo, at the sight of their mother, had taken flight. Carmina
      stood alone in the hall. Mrs. Gallilee had turned her cold. After awhile,
      she followed the children as far as her own room. There, her resolution
      failed her. She called faintly upstairs&mdash;&ldquo;Frances!&rdquo; There was no
      answering voice. She went into her room. A small paper packet was on the
      table; sealed, and addressed to herself. She tore it open. A ring with a
      spinel ruby in it dropped out: she recognised the stone&mdash;it was Miss
      Minerva&rsquo;s ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some blotted lines were traced on the paper inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried to pour out my heart to you in writing&mdash;and I have torn
      up the letters. The fewest words are the best. Look back at my confession&mdash;and
      you will know why I have left you. You shall hear from me, when I am more
      worthy of you than I am now. In the meantime, wear my ring. It will tell
      you how mean I once was. F. M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina looked at the ring. She remembered that Frances had tried to make
      her accept it as security, in return for the loan of thirty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She referred to the confession. Two passages in it were underlined: &ldquo;The
      wickedness in me, on which Mrs. Gallilee calculated, may be in me still.&rdquo;
       And, again: &ldquo;Even now, when you have found me out, I love him. Don&rsquo;t trust
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never had Carmina trusted her more faithfully than at that bitter moment!
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The ordinary aspect of the schoolroom was seen no more.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Installed in a position of temporary authority, the parlour-maid sat
      silently at her needlework. Maria stood by the window, in the new
      character of an idle girl&mdash;with her handkerchief in her hand, and her
      everlasting book dropped unnoticed on the floor. Zo lay flat on her back,
      on the hearth-rug, hugging the dog in her arms. At intervals, she rolled
      herself over slowly from side to side, and stared at the ceiling with
      wondering eyes. Miss Minerva&rsquo;s departure had struck the parlour-maid dumb,
      and had demoralized the pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria broke the silence at last. &ldquo;I wonder where Carmina is?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her room, most likely,&rdquo; the parlour-maid suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I better go and see after her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cautious parlour-maid declined to offer advice. Maria&rsquo;s well-balanced
      mind was so completely unhinged, that she looked with languid curiosity at
      her sister. Zo still stared at the ceiling, and still rolled slowly from
      one side to the other. The dog on her breast, lulled by the regular
      motion, slept profoundly&mdash;not even troubled by a dream of fleas!
    </p>
    <p>
      While Maria was still considering what it might be best to do, Carmina
      entered the room. She looked, as the servant afterwards described it,
      &ldquo;like a person who had lost her way.&rdquo; Maria exhibited the feeling of the
      schoolroom, by raising her handkerchief in solemn silence to her eyes.
      Without taking notice of this demonstration, Carmina approached the
      parlour-maid, and said, &ldquo;Did you see Miss Minerva before she went away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took her message, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The message, saying she wished to see my mistress for a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss, I was told to show the governess into the library. She went
      down with her bonnet on, ready dressed to go out. Before she had been five
      minutes with my mistress she came out again, and rang the hall-bell, and
      spoke to Joseph. &lsquo;My boxes are packed and directed,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;I will
      send for them in an hour&rsquo;s time. Good day, Joseph.&rsquo; And she stepped into
      the street, as quietly as if she was going out shopping round the corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the boxes been sent for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina lifted her head, and spoke in steadier tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have they been taken to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the flower-shop at the back&mdash;to be kept till called for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last faint hope of tracing Frances was at an end. Carmina turned
      wearily to leave the room. Zo called to her from the hearth-rug. Always
      kind to the child, she retraced her steps. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo got on her legs before she spoke, like a member of parliament. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been thinking about that governess,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I once tell
      you I was going to run away? And wasn&rsquo;t it because of Her? Hush! Here&rsquo;s
      the part of it I can&rsquo;t make out&mdash;She&rsquo;s run away from Me. I don&rsquo;t bear
      malice; I&rsquo;m only glad in myself. No more dirty nails. No more bread and
      water for tea. That&rsquo;s all. Good morning.&rdquo; Zo laid herself down again on
      the rug; and the dog laid himself down again on Zo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina returned to her room&mdash;to reflect on what she had heard from
      the parlour-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now plain that Mrs. Gallilee had not been allowed the opportunity
      of dismissing her governess at a moment&rsquo;s notice: Miss Minerva&rsquo;s sudden
      departure was unquestionably due to Miss Minerva herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, Carmina was able to think clearly&mdash;and no farther. The
      confused sense of helpless distress which she had felt, after reading the
      few farewell words that Frances had addressed to her, still oppressed her
      mind. There were moments when she vaguely understood, and bitterly
      lamented, the motives which had animated her unhappy friend. Other moments
      followed, when she impulsively resented the act which had thrown her on
      her own resources, at the very time when she had most need of the
      encouragement that could be afforded by the sympathy of a firmer nature
      than her own. She began to doubt the steadiness of her resolution&mdash;without
      Frances to take leave of her, on the morning of the escape. For the first
      time, she was now tortured by distrust of Ovid&rsquo;s reception of her; by
      dread of his possible disapproval of her boldness; by morbid suspicion
      even of his taking his mother&rsquo;s part. Bewildered and reckless, she threw
      herself on the sofa&mdash;her heart embittered against Frances&mdash;indifferent
      whether she lived or died.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner-time she sent a message, begging to be excused from appearing at
      the table. Mrs. Gallilee at once presented herself, harder and colder than
      ever, to inspect the invalid. Perceiving no immediate necessity for
      summoning Mr. Null, she said, &ldquo;Ring, if you want anything,&rdquo; and left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee followed, after an interval, with a little surreptitious
      offering of wine (hidden under his coat); and with a selection of tarts
      crammed into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smuggled goods, my dear,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;picked up when nobody happened
      to be looking my way. When we are miserable&mdash;has the idea ever
      occurred to you?&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sign from kind Providence that we are
      intended to eat and drink. The sherry&rsquo;s old, and the pastry melts in your
      mouth. Shall I stay with you? You would rather not? Just my feeling!
      Remarkable similarity in our opinions&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think so yourself?
      I&rsquo;m sorry for poor Miss Minerva. Suppose you go to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina was in no mood to profit by this excellent advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still walking restlessly up and down her room, when the time came
      for shutting up the house. With the sound of closing locks and bolts,
      there was suddenly mingled a sharp ring at the bell; followed by another
      unexpected event. Mr. Gallilee paid her a second visit&mdash;in a state of
      transformation. His fat face was flushed: he positively looked as if he
      was capable of feeling strong emotion, unconnected with champagne and the
      club! He presented a telegram to Carmina&mdash;and, when he spoke, there
      were thrills of agitation in the tones of his piping voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, something very unpleasant has happened. I met Joseph taking this
      to my wife. Highly improper, in my opinion,&mdash;what do you say
      yourself?&mdash;to take it to Mrs. Gallilee, when it&rsquo;s addressed to you.
      It was no mistake; he was so impudent as to say he had his orders. I have
      reproved Joseph.&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee looked astonished at himself, when he made
      this latter statement&mdash;then relapsed into his customary sweetness of
      temper. &ldquo;No bad news?&rdquo; he asked anxiously, when Carmina opened the
      telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news! the best of good news!&rdquo; she answered impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee looked as happy as if the welcome telegram had been addressed
      to himself. On his way out of the room, he underwent another relapse. The
      footman&rsquo;s audacious breach of trust began to trouble him once more: this
      time in its relation to Mrs. Gallilee. The serious part of it was, that
      the man had acted under his mistress&rsquo;s orders. Mr. Gallilee said&mdash;he
      actually said, without appealing to anybody&mdash;&ldquo;If this happens again,
      I shall be obliged to speak to my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telegram was from Teresa. It had been despatched from Paris that
      evening; and the message was thus expressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too tired to get on to England by to-night&rsquo;s mail. Shall leave by the
      early train to-morrow morning, and be with you by six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s mind was exactly in the state to feel unmingled relief, at the
      prospect of seeing the dear old friend of her happiest days. She laid her
      head on the pillow that night, without a thought of what might follow the
      event of Teresa&rsquo;s return.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day&mdash;the important Tuesday of the lecture on Matter; the
      delightful Tuesday of Teresa&rsquo;s arrival&mdash;brought with it special
      demands on Carmina&rsquo;s pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first letter was addressed to Frances. It was frankly and earnestly
      written; entreating Miss Minerva to appoint a place at which they might
      meet, and assuring her, in the most affectionate terms, that she was still
      loved, trusted, and admired by her faithful friend. Helped by her steadier
      flow of spirits, Carmina could now see all that was worthiest of sympathy
      and admiration, all that claimed loving submission and allowance from
      herself, in the sacrifice to which Miss Minerva had submitted. How bravely
      the poor governess had controlled the jealous misery that tortured her!
      How nobly she had pronounced Carmina&rsquo;s friendship for Carmina&rsquo;s sake!
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day, Marceline took the letter to the flower shop, and placed
      it herself under the cord of one of the boxes still waiting to be claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second letter filled many pages, and occupied the remainder of the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the utmost delicacy, but with perfect truthfulness at the same time,
      Carmina revealed to her betrothed husband the serious reasons which had
      forced her to withdraw herself from his mother&rsquo;s care. Bound to speak at
      last in her own defence, she felt that concealments and compromises would
      be alike unworthy of Ovid and of herself. What she had already written to
      Teresa, she now wrote again&mdash;with but one modification. She expressed
      herself forbearingly towards Ovid&rsquo;s mother. The closing words of the
      letter were worthy of Carmina&rsquo;s gentle, just, and generous nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will perhaps say, Why do I only hear now of all that you have
      suffered? My love, I have longed to tell you of it! I have even taken up
      my pen to begin. But I thought of you, and put it down again. How selfish,
      how cruel, to hinder your recovery by causing you sorrow and suspense to
      bring you back perhaps to England before your health was restored! I don&rsquo;t
      regret the effort that it has cost me to keep silence. My only sorrow in
      writing to you is, that I must speak of your mother in terms which may
      lower her in her son&rsquo;s estimation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph brought the luncheon up to Carmina&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress was still at her studies; the master had gone to his club. As
      for the girls, their only teacher for the present was the teacher of
      music. When the ordeal of the lecture and the discussion had been passed,
      Mrs. Gallilee threatened to take Miss Minerva&rsquo;s place herself, until a new
      governess could be found. For once, Maria and Zo showed a sisterly
      similarity in their feelings. It was hard to say which of the two looked
      forward to her learned mother&rsquo;s instruction with the greatest terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina heard the pupils at the piano, while she was eating her luncheon.
      The profanation of music ceased, when she went into the bedroom to get
      ready for her daily drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her letter, duly closed and stamped, downstairs with her&mdash;to
      be sent to the post with the other letters of the day, placed in the
      hall-basket. In the weakened state of her nerves, the effort that she had
      made in writing to Ovid had shaken her. Her heart beat uneasily; her knees
      trembled, as she descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in sight of the hall, she discovered a man walking slowly to and
      fro. He turned towards her as she advanced, and disclosed the detestable
      face of Mr. Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music-master&rsquo;s last reserves of patience had come to an end. Watch for
      them as he might, no opportunities had presented themselves of renewing
      his investigation in Carmina&rsquo;s room. In the interval that had passed, his
      hungry suspicion of her had been left to feed on itself. The motives for
      that incomprehensible attempt to make a friend of him remained hidden in
      as thick a darkness as ever. Victim of adverse circumstances, he had
      determined (with the greatest reluctance) to take the straightforward
      course. Instead of secretly getting his information from Carmina&rsquo;s
      journals and letters, he was now reduced to openly applying for
      enlightenment to Carmina herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupying, for the time being, the position of an honourable man, he
      presented himself at cruel disadvantage. He was not master of his own
      glorious voice; he was without the self-possession indispensable to the
      perfect performance of his magnificent bow. &ldquo;I have waited to have a word
      with you,&rdquo; he began abruptly, &ldquo;before you go out for your drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already unnerved, even before she had seen him&mdash;painfully conscious
      that she had committed a serious error, on the last occasion when they had
      met, in speaking at all&mdash;Carmina neither answered him nor looked at
      him. She bent her head confusedly, and advanced a little nearer to the
      house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once moved so as to place himself in her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must request you to call to mind what passed between us,&rdquo; he resumed,
      &ldquo;when we met by accident some little time since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had speculated on frightening her. His insolence stirred her spirit
      into asserting itself. &ldquo;Let me by, if you please,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the carriage
      is waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage can wait a little longer,&rdquo; he answered coarsely. &ldquo;On the
      occasion to which I have referred, you were so good as to make advances,
      to which I cannot consider myself as having any claim. Perhaps you will
      favour me by stating your motives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped back, and laid her hand on the bell which rang below stairs,
      in the pantry. &ldquo;Must I ring?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that she would do it, if he moved a step nearer to her. He
      drew aside&mdash;with a look which made her tremble. On passing the hall
      table, she placed her letter in the post-basket. His eye followed it, as
      it left her hand: he became suddenly penitent and polite. &ldquo;I am sorry if I
      have alarmed you,&rdquo; he said, and opened the house-door for her&mdash;without
      showing himself to Marceline and the coachman outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage having been driven away, he softly closed the door again, and
      returned to the hall-table. He looked into the post-basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there any danger of discovery by the servants? The footman was absent,
      attending his mistress on her way to the lecture. None of the female
      servants were on the stairs. He took up Carmina&rsquo;s letter, and looked at
      the address: <i>To Ovid Vere, Esq.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes twinkled furtively; his excellent memory for injuries reminded
      him that Ovid Vere had formerly endeavoured (without even caring to
      conceal it) to prevent Mrs. Gallilee from engaging him as her
      music-master. By subtle links of its own forging, his vindictive nature
      now connected his hatred of the person to whom the letter was addressed,
      with his interest in stealing the letter itself for the possible discovery
      of Carmina&rsquo;s secrets. The clock told him that there was plenty of time to
      open the envelope, and (if the contents proved to be of no importance) to
      close it again, and take it himself to the post. After a last look round,
      he withdrew undiscovered, with the letter in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      On its way back to the house, the carriage was passed by a cab, with a man
      in it, driven at such a furious rate that there was a narrow escape of
      collision. The maid screamed; Carmina turned pale; the coachman wondered
      why the man in the cab was in such a hurry. The man was Mr. Mool&rsquo;s head
      clerk, charged with news for Doctor Benjulia.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mind of the clerk&rsquo;s master had been troubled by serious doubts, after
      Carmina left his house on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her agitated manner, her strange questions, and her abrupt departure, all
      suggested to Mr. Mool&rsquo;s mind some rash project in contemplation&mdash;perhaps
      even the plan of an elopement. To most other men, the obvious course to
      take would have been to communicate with Mrs. Gallilee. But the lawyer
      preserved a vivid remembrance of the interview which had taken place at
      his office. The detestable pleasure which Mrs. Gallilee had betrayed in
      profaning the memory of Carmina&rsquo;s mother, had so shocked and disgusted
      him, that he recoiled from the idea of holding any further intercourse
      with her, no matter how pressing the emergency might be. It was possible,
      after what had passed, that Carmina might feel the propriety of making
      some explanation by letter. He decided to wait until the next morning, on
      the chance of hearing from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Monday, no letter arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding to the office, Mr. Mool found, in his business-correspondence,
      enough to occupy every moment of his time. He had purposed writing to
      Carmina, but the idea was now inevitably pressed out of his mind. It was
      only at the close of the day&rsquo;s work that he had leisure to think of a
      matter of greater importance&mdash;that is to say, of the necessity of
      discovering Benjulia&rsquo;s friend of other days, the Italian teacher Baccani.
      He left instructions with one of his clerks to make inquiries, the next
      morning, at the shops of foreign booksellers. There, and there only, the
      question might be answered, whether Baccani was still living, and living
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inquiries proved successful. On Tuesday afternoon, Baccani&rsquo;s address
      was in Mr. Mool&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Busy as he still was, the lawyer set aside his own affairs, in deference
      to the sacred duty of defending the memory of the dead, and to the
      pressing necessity of silencing Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s cruel and slanderous
      tongue. Arrived at Baccani&rsquo;s lodgings, he was informed that the
      language-master had gone to his dinner at a neighbouring restaurant. Mr.
      Mool waited at the lodgings, and sent a note to Baccani. In ten minutes
      more he found himself in the presence of an elderly man, of ascetic
      appearance; whose looks and tones showed him to be apt to take offence on
      small provocation, and more than half ready to suspect an eminent
      solicitor of being a spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Mool&rsquo;s experience was equal to the call on it. Having fully
      explained the object that he had in view, he left the apology for his
      intrusion to be inferred, and concluded by appealing, in his own modest
      way, to the sympathy of an honourable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently forming his opinion of the lawyer, while he listened, Baccani
      expressed the conclusion at which he had arrived, in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My experience of mankind, sir, has been a bitterly bad one. You have
      improved my opinion of human nature since you entered this room. That is
      not a little thing to say, at my age and in my circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed gravely, and turned to his bed. From under it, he pulled out a
      clumsy tin box. Having opened the rusty lock with some difficulty, he
      produced a ragged pocket-book, and picked out from it a paper which looked
      like an old letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, handing the paper to Mr. Mool, &ldquo;is the statement which
      vindicates this lady&rsquo;s reputation. Before you open the manuscript I must
      tell you how I came by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to feel such embarrassment in approaching the subject, that
      Mr. Mool interposed. &ldquo;I am already acquainted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with some of the
      circumstances to which you are about to allude. I happen to know of the
      wager in which the calumny originated, and of the manner in which that
      wager was decided. The events which followed are the only events that I
      need trouble you to describe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baccani&rsquo;s grateful sense of relief avowed itself without reserve. &ldquo;I feel
      your kindness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;almost as keenly as I feel my own disgraceful
      conduct, in permitting a woman&rsquo;s reputation to be made the subject of a
      wager. From whom did you obtain your information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the person who mentioned your name to me&mdash;Doctor Benjulia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baccani lifted his hand with a gesture of angry protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of him again in my presence!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;That man has
      insulted me. When I took refuge from political persecution in this
      country, I sent him my prospectus. From my own humble position as a
      teacher of languages, I looked up without envy to his celebrity among
      doctors; I thought I might remind him, not unfavourably, of our early
      friendship&mdash;I, who had done him a hundred kindnesses in those past
      days. He has never taken the slightest notice of me; he has not even
      acknowledged the receipt of my prospectus. Despicable wretch! Let me hear
      no more of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray forgive me if I refer to him again&mdash;for the last time,&rdquo; Mr.
      Mool pleaded. &ldquo;Did your acquaintance with him continue, after the question
      of the wager had been settled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; Baccani answered sternly. &ldquo;When I was at leisure to go to the
      club at which we were accustomed to meet, he had left Rome. From that time
      to this&mdash;I rejoice to say it&mdash;I have never set eyes on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The obstacles which had prevented the refutation of the calumny from
      reaching Benjulia were now revealed. Mr. Mool had only to hear, next, how
      that refutation had been obtained. A polite hint sufficed to remind
      Baccani of the explanation that he had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am naturally suspicious,&rdquo; he began abruptly; &ldquo;and I doubted the woman
      when I found that she kept her veil down. Besides, it was not in my way of
      thinking to believe that an estimable married lady could have compromised
      herself with a scoundrel, who had boasted that she was his mistress. I
      waited in the street, until the woman came out. I followed her, and saw
      her meet a man. The two went together to a theatre. I took my place near
      them. She lifted her veil as a matter of course. My suspicion of foul play
      was instantly confirmed. When the performance was over, I traced her back
      to Mr. Robert Graywell&rsquo;s house. He and his wife were both absent at a
      party. I was too indignant to wait till they came back. Under the threat
      of charging the wretch with stealing her mistress&rsquo;s clothes, I extorted
      from her the signed confession which you have in your hand. She was under
      notice to leave her place for insolent behaviour. The personation which
      had been intended to deceive me, was an act of revenge; planned between
      herself and the blackguard who had employed her to make his lie look like
      truth. A more shameless creature I never met with. She said to me, &lsquo;I am
      as tall as my mistress, and a better figure; and I&rsquo;ve often worn her fine
      clothes on holiday occasions.&rsquo; In your country Mr. Mool, such women&mdash;so
      I am told&mdash;are ducked in a pond. There is one thing more to add,
      before you read the confession. Mrs. Robert Graywell did imprudently send
      the man some money&mdash;in answer to a begging letter artfully enough
      written to excite her pity. A second application was refused by her
      husband. What followed on that, you know already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having read the confession, Mr. Mool was permitted to take a copy, and to
      make any use of it which he might think desirable. His one remaining
      anxiety was to hear what had become of the person who had planned the
      deception. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that villain has not escaped punishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baccani answered this in his own bitter way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, how can you ask such a simple question? That sort of man
      always escapes punishment. In the last extreme of poverty his luck
      provides him with somebody to cheat. Common respect for Mrs. Robert
      Graywell closed my lips; and I was the only person acquainted with the
      circumstances. I wrote to our club declaring the fellow to be a cheat&mdash;and
      leaving it to be inferred that he cheated at cards. He knew better than to
      insist on my explaining myself&mdash;he resigned, and disappeared. I dare
      say he is living still&mdash;living in clover on some unfortunate woman.
      The beautiful and the good die untimely deaths. <i>He,</i> and his kind,
      last and live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool had neither time nor inclination to plead in favour of the more
      hopeful view, which believes in the agreeable fiction called &ldquo;Poetical
      justice.&rdquo; He tried to express his sense of obligation at parting. Baccani
      refused to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The obligation is all on my side,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As I have already told you,
      your visit has added a bright day to my calendar. In our pilgrimage, my
      friend, through this world of rogues and fools, we may never meet again.
      Let us remember gratefully that we <i>have</i> met. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to his office, Mr. Mool attached to the copy of the confession a
      brief statement of the circumstances under which the Italian had become
      possessed of it. He then added these lines, addressed to Benjulia:&mdash;<i>&ldquo;You</i>
      set the false report afloat. I leave it to your sense of duty, to decide
      whether you ought not to go at once to Mrs. Gallilee, and tell her that
      the slander which you repeated is now proved to be a lie. If you don&rsquo;t
      agree with me, I must go to Mrs. Gallilee myself. In that case please
      return, by the bearer, the papers which are enclosed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk instructed to deliver these documents, within the shortest
      possible space of time, found Mr. Mool waiting at the office, on his
      return. He answered his master&rsquo;s inquiries by producing Benjulia&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s amiable humour was still in the ascendant. His success in
      torturing his unfortunate cook had been followed by the receipt of a
      telegram from his friend at Montreal, containing this satisfactory answer
      to his question:&mdash;&ldquo;Not brain disease.&rdquo; With his mind now set
      completely at rest, his instincts as a gentleman were at full liberty to
      control him. &ldquo;I entirely agree with you,&rdquo; he wrote to Mr. Mool. &ldquo;I go back
      with your clerk; the cab will drop me at Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool turned to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you wait to hear if Mrs. Gallilee was at home?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee was absent, sir&mdash;attending a lecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Doctor Benjulia do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went into the house, to wait her return.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s page (attending to the house-door, in the footman&rsquo;s
      absence) had just shown Benjulia into the library, when there was another
      ring at the bell. The new visitor was Mr. Le Frank. He appeared to be in a
      hurry. Without any preliminary questions, he said, &ldquo;Take my card to Mrs.
      Gallilee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress is out, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music-master looked impatiently at the hall-clock. The hall-clock
      answered him by striking the half hour after five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect Mrs. Gallilee back soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, sir. The footman had his orders to be in waiting with the
      carriage, at five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of irritable reflection, Mr. Le Frank took a letter from
      his pocket. &ldquo;Say that I have an appointment, and am not able to wait. Give
      Mrs. Gallilee that letter the moment she comes in.&rdquo; With those directions
      he left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page looked at the letter. It was sealed; and, over the address, two
      underlined words were written:&mdash;&ldquo;Private. Immediate.&rdquo; Mindful of
      visits from tradespeople, anxious to see his mistress, and provided
      beforehand with letters to be delivered immediately, the boy took a
      pecuniary view of Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s errand at the house. &ldquo;Another of them,&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;wanting his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he placed the letter on the hall-table, the library door opened, and
      Benjulia appeared&mdash;weary already of waiting, without occupation, for
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is smoking allowed in the library?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page looked up at the giant towering over him, with the envious
      admiration of a short boy. He replied with a discretion beyond his years:
      &ldquo;Would you please step into the smoking-room, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia at once declined the invitation to the smoking-room. &ldquo;Anybody
      else at home?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Carmina was upstairs&mdash;the page answered. &ldquo;And I think,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;Mr. Null is with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Mr. Null?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia declined to disturb the doctor. He tried a third, and last
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Zo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried a shrill voice from the upper regions. &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the page&rsquo;s astonishment, the giant gentleman with the resonant bass
      voice answered this quite gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Benjulia,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up!&rdquo; cried Zo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia ascended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; shouted the voice from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got your big stick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it up with you.&rdquo; Benjulia retraced his steps into the hall. The
      page respectfully handed him his stick. Zo became impatient. &ldquo;Look sharp!&rdquo;
       she called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia obediently quickened his pace. Zo left the schoolroom (in spite
      of the faintly-heard protest of the maid in charge) to receive him on the
      stairs. They met on the landing, outside Carmina&rsquo;s room. Zo possessed
      herself of the bamboo cane, and led the way in. &ldquo;Carmina! here&rsquo;s the big
      stick, I told you about,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose stick, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo returned to the landing. &ldquo;Come in, Benjulia,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and seized
      him by the coat-tails. Mr. Null rose instinctively. Was this his
      celebrated colleague?
    </p>
    <p>
      With some reluctance, Carmina appeared at the door; thinking of the day
      when Ovid had fainted, and when the great man had treated her so harshly.
      In fear of more rudeness, she unwillingly asked him to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still immovable on the landing, he looked at her in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious question occurred to him which had formerly presented itself
      to Mr. Mool. Had Mrs. Gallilee repeated, in Carmina&rsquo;s presence, the lie
      which slandered her mother&rsquo;s memory&mdash;the lie which he was then in the
      house to expose?
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching Benjulia respectfully, Mr. Null saw, in that grave scrutiny, an
      opportunity of presenting himself under a favourable light. He waved his
      hand persuasively towards Carmina. &ldquo;Some nervous prostration, sir, in my
      interesting patient, as you no doubt perceive,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Not such rapid
      progress towards recovery as I had hoped. I think of recommending the air
      of the seaside.&rdquo; Benjulia&rsquo;s dreary eyes turned on him slowly, and
      estimated his mental calibre at its exact value, in a moment. Mr. Null
      felt that look in the very marrow of his bones. He bowed with servile
      submission, and took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Benjulia had satisfied himself that the embarrassment in
      Carmina&rsquo;s manner was merely attributable to shyness. She was now no longer
      an object even of momentary interest to him. He was ready to play with Zo&mdash;but
      not on condition of amusing himself with the child, in Carmina&rsquo;s presence.
      &ldquo;I am waiting till Mrs. Gallilee returns,&rdquo; he said to her in his quietly
      indifferent way. &ldquo;If you will excuse me, I&rsquo;ll go downstairs again; I won&rsquo;t
      intrude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her pale face flushed as she listened to him. Innocently supposing that
      she had made her little offer of hospitality in too cold a manner, she
      looked at Benjulia with a timid and troubled smile. &ldquo;Pray wait here till
      my aunt comes back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Zo will amuse you, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; Zo seconded
      the invitation by hiding the stick, and laying hold again on her big
      friend&rsquo;s coattails.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let the child drag him into the room, without noticing her. The silent
      questioning of his eyes had been again directed to Carmina, at the moment
      when she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      His long and terrible experience made its own merciless discoveries, in
      the nervous movement of her eyelids and her lips. The poor girl, pleasing
      herself with the idea of having produced the right impression on him at
      last, had only succeeded in becoming an object of medical inquiry, pursued
      in secret. When he companionably took a chair by her side, and let Zo
      climb on his knee, he was privately regretting his cold reception of Mr.
      Null. Under certain conditions of nervous excitement, Carmina might
      furnish an interesting case. &ldquo;If I had been commonly civil to that fawning
      idiot,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I might have been called into consultation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all three seated&mdash;but there was no talk. Zo set the
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t tickled me yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Show Carmina how you do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gravely operated on the back of Zo&rsquo;s neck; and his patient acknowledged
      the process with a wriggle and a scream. The performance being so far at
      an end, Zo called to the dog, and issued her orders once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now make Tinker kick his leg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia obeyed once again. The young tyrant was not satisfied yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tickle Carmina!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard this without laughing: his fleshless lips never relaxed into a
      smile. To Carmina&rsquo;s unutterable embarrassment, he looked at her, when she
      laughed, with steadier attention than ever. Those coldly-inquiring eyes
      exercised some inscrutable influence over her. Now they made her angry;
      and now they frightened her. The silence that had fallen on them again,
      became an unendurable infliction. She burst into talk; she was loud and
      familiar&mdash;ashamed of her own boldness, and quite unable to control
      it. &ldquo;You are very fond of Zo!&rdquo; she said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a perfectly commonplace remark&mdash;and yet, it seemed to perplex
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on. Against her own will, she persisted in speaking to him. &ldquo;And
      I&rsquo;m sure Zo is fond of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Zo. &ldquo;Are you fond of me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo, staring hard at him, got off his knee; retired to a little distance to
      think; and stood staring at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quietly repeated the question. Zo answered this time&mdash;as she had
      formerly answered Teresa in the Gardens. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned again to Carmina, in a slow, puzzled way. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the big man own that he was no wiser than herself, Zo returned to
      him&mdash;without, however, getting on his knee again. She clasped her
      chubby hands under the inspiration of a new idea. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play at
      something,&rdquo; she said to Benjulia. &ldquo;Do you know any games?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know any games, when you were only as big as me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got a wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a miserable chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to Zo, Carmina&rsquo;s sense of nervous oppression burst its way into
      relief. She laughed loudly and wildly&mdash;she was on the verge of
      hysterics, when Benjulia&rsquo;s eyes, silently questioning her again,
      controlled her at the critical moment. Her laughter died away. But the
      exciting influence still possessed her; still forced her into the other
      alternative of saying something&mdash;she neither knew nor cared what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t live such a lonely life as yours,&rdquo; she said to him&mdash;so
      loudly and so confidently that even Zo noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t live such a life either,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so loud?&rdquo; Zo interposed. &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s deaf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia made a sign, commanding the child to be silent&mdash;without
      turning towards her. He answered Carmina as if there had been no
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My medical studies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;reconcile me to my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you got tired of your studies?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never get tired of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you couldn&rsquo;t study any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I shouldn&rsquo;t live any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that it would kill you to leave off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his great soft fingers on her pulse. She shrank from his touch; he
      deliberately held her by the arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting excited,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Never mind what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo, left unnoticed and not liking it, saw a chance of asserting herself.
      &ldquo;I know why Carmina&rsquo;s excited,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The old woman&rsquo;s coming at six
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paid no attention to the child; he persisted in keeping watch on
      Carmina. &ldquo;Who is the woman?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most lovable woman in the world,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;my dear old nurse!&rdquo; She
      started up from the sofa, and pointed with theatrical exaggeration of
      gesture to the clock on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;Look! it&rsquo;s only ten minutes to
      six. In ten minutes, I shall have my arms round Teresa&rsquo;s neck. Don&rsquo;t look
      at me in that way! It&rsquo;s your fault if I&rsquo;m excited. It&rsquo;s your dreadful eyes
      that do it. Come here, Zo! I want to give you a kiss.&rdquo; She seized on Zo
      with a roughness that startled the child, and looked wildly at Benjulia.
      &ldquo;Ha! you don&rsquo;t understand loving and kissing, do you? What&rsquo;s the use of
      speaking to <i>you</i> about my old nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed imperatively to the sofa. &ldquo;Sit down again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed him&mdash;but he had not quite composed her yet. Her eyes
      sparkled; she went on talking. &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re a hard man! a miserable man! a
      man that will end badly! You never loved anybody. You don&rsquo;t know what love
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That icy question cooled her in an instant: her head sank on her bosom:
      she suddenly became indifferent to persons and things about her. &ldquo;When
      will Teresa come?&rdquo; she whispered to herself. &ldquo;Oh, when will Teresa come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any other man, whether he really felt for her or not, would, as a mere
      matter of instinct, have said a kind word to her at that moment. Not the
      vestige of a change appeared in Benjulia&rsquo;s impenetrable composure. She
      might have been a man&mdash;or a baby&mdash;or the picture of a girl
      instead of the girl herself, so far as he was concerned. He quietly
      returned to his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed&mdash;&ldquo;and what is love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word, not a movement escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; he persisted, waiting for what might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing happened. He was not perplexed by the sudden change. &ldquo;This is the
      reaction,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;We shall see what comes of it.&rdquo; He looked about
      him. A bottle of water stood on one of the tables. &ldquo;Likely to be useful,&rdquo;
       he concluded, &ldquo;in case she feels faint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo had been listening; Zo saw her way to getting noticed again. Not quite
      sure of herself this time, she appealed to Carmina. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say, just
      now, he wanted to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina neither heard nor heeded her. Zo tried Benjulia next. &ldquo;Shall I
      tell you what we do in the schoolroom, when we want to know?&rdquo; His
      attention, like Carmina&rsquo;s attention, seemed to be far away from her. Zo
      impatiently reminded him of her presence&mdash;she laid her hand on his
      knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only the hand of a child&mdash;an idle, quaint, perverse child&mdash;but
      it touched, ignorantly touched, the one tender place in his nature,
      unprofaned by the infernal cruelties which made his life acceptable to
      him; the one tender place, hidden so deep from the man himself, that even
      his far-reaching intellect groped in vain to find it out. There,
      nevertheless, was the feeling which drew him to Zo, contending
      successfully with his medical interest in a case of nervous derangement.
      That unintelligible sympathy with a child looked dimly out of his eyes,
      spoke faintly in his voice, when he replied to her. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
      do you do in the schoolroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We look in the dictionary,&rdquo; Zo answered. &ldquo;Carmina&rsquo;s got a dictionary.
      I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She climbed on a chair, and found the book, and laid it on Benjulia&rsquo;s lap.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t so much mind trying to spell a word,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;What I hate
      is being asked what it means. Miss Minerva won&rsquo;t let me off. She says,
      Look. <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t let <i>you</i> off. I&rsquo;m Miss Minerva and you&rsquo;re Zo.
      Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He humoured her silently and mechanically&mdash;just as he had humoured
      her in the matter of the stick, and in the matter of the tickling. Having
      opened the dictionary, he looked again at Carmina. She had not moved; she
      seemed to be weary enough to fall asleep. The reaction&mdash;nothing but
      the reaction. It might last for hours, or it might be at an end in another
      minute. An interesting temperament, whichever way it ended. He opened the
      dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love?&rdquo; he muttered grimly to himself. &ldquo;It seems I&rsquo;m an object of
      compassion, because I know nothing about love. Well, what does the book
      say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found the word, and ran his finger down the paragraphs of explanation
      which followed. &ldquo;Seven meanings to Love,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;First: An
      affection of the mind excited by beauty and worth of any kind, or by the
      qualities of an object which communicate pleasure. Second: Courtship.
      Third: Patriotism, as the love of country. Fourth: Benevolence. Fifth: The
      object beloved. Sixth: A word of endearment. Seventh: Cupid, the god of
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and reflected a little. Zo, hearing nothing to amuse her,
      strayed away to the window, and looked out. He glanced at Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of those meanings makes the pleasure of her life?&rdquo; he wondered.
      &ldquo;Which of them might have made the pleasure of mine?&rdquo; He closed the
      dictionary in contempt. &ldquo;The very man whose business is to explain it,
      tries seven different ways, and doesn&rsquo;t explain it after all. And yet,
      there is such a thing.&rdquo; He reached that conclusion unwillingly and
      angrily. For the first time, a doubt about himself forced its way into his
      mind. Might he have looked higher than his torture-table and his knife?
      Had he gained from his life all that his life might have given to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by herself, Zo began to grow tired of it. She tried to get Carmina
      for a companion. &ldquo;Come and look out of window,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina gently refused: she was unwilling to be disturbed. Since she had
      spoken to Benjulia, her thoughts had been dwelling restfully on Ovid. In
      another day she might be on her way to him. When would Teresa come?
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia was too preoccupied to notice her. The weak doubt that had got
      the better of his strong reason, still held him in thrall. &ldquo;Love!&rdquo; he
      broke out, in the bitterness of his heart. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of
      sentiment: it&rsquo;s a question of use. Who is the better for love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard the last words, and answered him. &ldquo;Everybody is the better for
      it.&rdquo; She looked at him with sorrowful eyes, and laid her hand on his arm.
      &ldquo;Everybody,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled scornfully. &ldquo;Everybody is the better for it,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And
      who knows what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew away her hand, and looked towards the heavenly tranquillity of
      the evening sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows what it is?&rdquo; he reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia was silent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The clock on the mantelpiece struck six. Zo, turning suddenly from the
      window, ran to the sofa. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the carriage!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo; Carmina exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo crossed the room, on tiptoe, to the door of the bed-chamber. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      mamma,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell! I&rsquo;m going to hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this was given mysteriously in a whisper. &ldquo;She said I wasn&rsquo;t
      to come to you. She&rsquo;s a quick one on her legs&mdash;she might catch me on
      the stairs.&rdquo; With that explanation, Zo slipped into the bedroom, and held
      the door ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes passed&mdash;and Mrs. Gallilee failed to justify the opinion
      expressed by her daughter. Not a sound was audible on the stairs. Not a
      word more was uttered in the room. Benjulia had taken the child&rsquo;s place at
      the window. He sat there thinking. Carmina had suggested to him some new
      ideas, relating to the intricate connection between human faith and human
      happiness. Slowly, slowly, the clock recorded the lapse of minutes.
      Carmina&rsquo;s nervous anxiety began to forecast disaster to the absent nurse.
      She took Teresa&rsquo;s telegram from her pocket, and consulted it again. There
      was no mistake; six o&rsquo;clock was the time named for the traveller&rsquo;s arrival&mdash;and
      it was close on ten minutes past the hour. In her ignorance of railway
      arrangements, she took it for granted that trains were punctual. But her
      reading had told her that trains were subject to accident. &ldquo;I suppose
      delays occur,&rdquo; she said to Benjulia, &ldquo;without danger to the passengers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could answer&mdash;Mrs. Gallilee suddenly entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had opened the door so softly, that she took them both by surprise. To
      Carmina&rsquo;s excited imagination, she glided into their presence like a
      ghost. Her look and manner showed serious agitation, desperately
      suppressed. In certain places, the paint and powder on her face had
      cracked, and revealed the furrows and wrinkles beneath. Her hard eyes
      glittered; her laboured breathing was audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indifferent to all demonstrations of emotion which did not scientifically
      concern him, Benjulia quietly rose and advanced towards her. She seemed to
      be unconscious of his presence. He spoke&mdash;allowing her to ignore him
      without troubling himself to notice her temper. &ldquo;When you are able to
      attend to me, I want to speak to you. Shall I wait downstairs?&rdquo; He took
      his hat and stick&mdash;to leave the room; looked at Carmina as he passed
      her; and at once went back to his place at the window. Her aunt&rsquo;s silent
      and sinister entrance had frightened her. Benjulia waited, in the
      interests of physiology, to see how the new nervous excitement would end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, Mrs. Gallilee had kept one of her hands hidden behind her. She
      advanced close to Carmina, and allowed her hand to be seen. It held an
      open letter. She shook the letter in her niece&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the position which Mrs. Gallilee now occupied, Carmina was hidden, for
      the moment, from Benjulia&rsquo;s view. Biding his time at the window, he looked
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab, with luggage on it, had just drawn up at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this the old nurse who had been expected to arrive at six o&rsquo;clock?
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman came out to open the cab-door. He was followed by Mr.
      Gallilee, eager to help the person inside to alight. The traveller proved
      to be a grey-headed woman, shabbily dressed. Mr. Gallilee cordially shook
      hands with her&mdash;patted her on the shoulder&mdash;gave her his arm&mdash;led
      her into the house. The cab with the luggage on it remained at the door.
      The nurse had evidently not reached the end of her journey yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina shrank back on the sofa, when the leaves of the letter touched her
      face. Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s first words were now spoken, in a whisper. The inner
      fury of her anger, struggling for a vent, began to get the better of her&mdash;she
      gasped for breath and speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know this letter?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmina looked at the writing. It was the letter to Ovid, which she had
      placed in the post-basket that afternoon; the letter which declared that
      she could no longer endure his mother&rsquo;s cold-blooded cruelty, and that she
      only waited Teresa&rsquo;s arrival to join him at Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      After one dreadful moment of confusion, her mind realised the outrage
      implied in the stealing and reading of her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the earlier time of Carmina&rsquo;s sojourn in the house, Mrs. Gallilee had
      accused her of deliberate deceit. She had instantly resented the insult by
      leaving the room. The same spirit in her&mdash;the finely-strung spirit
      that vibrates unfelt in gentle natures, while they live in peace&mdash;steadied
      those quivering nerves, roused that failing courage. She met the furious
      eyes fixed on her, without shrinking; she spoke gravely and firmly. &ldquo;The
      letter is mine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How did you come by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare <i>you</i> steal my letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee tore open the fastening of her dress at the throat, to get
      breath. &ldquo;You impudent bastard!&rdquo; she burst out, in a frenzy of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting patiently at the window, Benjulia heard her. &ldquo;Hold your damned
      tongue!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s your niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee turned on him: her fury broke into a screaming laugh. &ldquo;My
      niece?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;You lie&mdash;and you know it! She&rsquo;s the child of
      an adulteress! She&rsquo;s the child of her mother&rsquo;s lover!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened as those horrible words passed her lips. The nurse and her
      husband entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in no position to see them: she was incapable of hearing them. The
      demon in her urged her on: she attempted to reiterate the detestable
      falsehood. Her first word died away in silence. The lean brown fingers of
      the Italian woman had her by the throat&mdash;held her as the claws of a
      tigress might have held her. Her eyes rolled in the mute agony of an
      appeal for help. In vain! in vain! Not a cry, not a sound, had drawn
      attention to the attack. Her husband&rsquo;s eyes were fixed, horror-struck, on
      the victim of her rage. Benjulia had crossed the room to the sofa, when
      Carmina heard the words spoken of her mother. From that moment, he was
      watching the case. Mr. Gallilee alone looked round&mdash;when the nurse
      tightened her hold in a last merciless grasp; dashed the insensible woman
      on the floor; and, turning back, fell on her knees at her darling&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up in Carmina&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ghastly stare, through half-closed eyes, showed death in life, blankly
      returning her look. The shock had struck Carmina with a stony calm. She
      had not started, she had not swooned. Rigid, immovable, there she sat;
      voiceless and tearless; insensible even to touch; her arms hanging down;
      her clenched hands resting on either side of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa grovelled and groaned at her feet. Those ferocious hands that had
      laid the slanderer prostrate on the floor, feebly beat her bosom and her
      gray head. &ldquo;Oh, Saints beloved of God! Oh, blessed Virgin, mother of
      Christ, spare my child, my sweet child!&rdquo; She rose in wild despair&mdash;she
      seized Benjulia, and madly shook him. &ldquo;Who are you? How dare you touch
      her? Give her to me, or I&rsquo;ll be the death of you. Oh, my Carmina, is it
      sleep that holds you? Wake! wake! wake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said Benjulia, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped on the sofa by Carmina&rsquo;s side, and lifted one of the cold
      clenched hands to her lips. The tears fell slowly over her haggard face.
      &ldquo;I am very fond of her, sir,&rdquo; she said humbly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only an old woman. See
      what a dreadful welcome my child gives to me. It&rsquo;s hard on an old woman&mdash;hard
      on an old woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His self-possession was not disturbed&mdash;even by this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I am?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I am a doctor. Leave her to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a doctor. That&rsquo;s good. A doctor&rsquo;s good. Yes, yes. Does the old man
      know this doctor&mdash;the kind old man?&rdquo; She looked vacantly for Mr.
      Gallilee. He was bending over his wife, sprinkling water on her deathly
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa got on her feet, and pointed to Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;The breath of that
      She-Devil poisons the air,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must take my child out of it. To
      my place, sir, if you please. Only to my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She attempted to lift Carmina from the sofa&mdash;and drew back,
      breathlessly watching her. Her rigid face faintly relaxed; her eyelids
      closed, and quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee looked up from his wife. &ldquo;Will one of you help me?&rdquo; he asked.
      His tone struck Benjulia. It was the hushed tone of sorrow&mdash;no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to it directly.&rdquo; With that reply, Benjulia turned to Teresa.
      &ldquo;Where is your place?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Far or near?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The message,&rdquo; she answered confusedly. &ldquo;The message says.&rdquo; She signed to
      him to look in her hand-bag&mdash;dropped on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Carmina&rsquo;s telegram, containing the address of the lodgings. The
      house was close by. After some consideration, he sent the nurse into the
      bedroom, with instructions to bring him the blankets off the bed. In the
      minute that followed, he examined Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be
      frightened about. Let her maid attend to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee again surprised Benjulia. He turned from his wife, and looked
      at Carmina. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t leave her here!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;After
      what she has heard, this house is no place for her. Give her to the old
      nurse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia only answered, as he had answered already&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to it.&rdquo;
       Mr. Gallilee persisted. &ldquo;Is there any risk in moving her?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least of two risks. No more questions! Look to your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee obeyed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he lifted his head again, and rose to ring the bell for the maid, the
      room was silent and lonely. A little pale frightened face peeped out
      through the bedroom door. Zo ventured in. Her father caught her in his
      arms, and kissed her as he had never kissed her yet. His eyes were wet
      with tears. Zo noticed that he never said a word about mamma. The child
      saw the change in her father, as Benjulia had seen it. She shared one
      human feeling with her big friend&mdash;she, too, was surprised.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE first signs of reviving life had begun to appear, when Marceline
      answered the bell. In a few minutes more, it was possible to raise Mrs.
      Gallilee and to place her on the sofa. Having so far assisted the servant,
      Mr. Gallilee took Zo by the hand, and drew back. Daunted by the terrible
      scene which she had witnessed from her hiding-place, the child stood by
      her father&rsquo;s side in silence. The two waited together, watching Mrs.
      Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked wildly round the room. Discovering that she was alone with the
      members of her family, she became composed: her mind slowly recovered its
      balance. Her first thought was for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has that woman disfigured me?&rdquo; she said to the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing nothing of what had happened, Marceline was at a loss to
      understand her. &ldquo;Bring me a glass,&rdquo; she said. The maid found a hand-glass
      in the bedroom, and presented it to her. She looked at herself&mdash;and
      drew a long breath of relief. That first anxiety at an end, she spoke to
      her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Carmina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the house&mdash;thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer seemed to bewilder her: she appealed to Marceline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say, thank God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can <i>you</i> tell me nothing? Who knows where Carmina has gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph knows, ma&rsquo;am. He heard Dr. Benjulia give the address to the
      cabman.&rdquo; With that answer, she turned anxiously to her master. &ldquo;Is Miss
      Carmina seriously ill, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mistress spoke again, before Mr. Gallilee could reply. &ldquo;Marceline!
      send Joseph up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife eyed him with astonishment. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said quietly, &ldquo;I forbid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee addressed herself to the maid. &ldquo;Go to my room, and bring me
      another bonnet and a veil. Stop!&rdquo; She tried to rise, and sank back. &ldquo;I
      must have something to strengthen me. Get the sal volatile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marceline left the room. Mr. Gallilee followed her as far as the door&mdash;still
      leading his little daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back, my dear, to your sister in the schoolroom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am
      distressed, Zo; be a good girl, and you will console me. Say the same to
      Maria. It will be dull for you, I am afraid. Be patient, my child, and try
      to bear it for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I whisper something?&rdquo; said Zo. &ldquo;Will Carmina die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they bring her back here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her eagerness, the child spoke above a whisper. Mrs. Gallilee heard the
      question, and answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will bring Carmina back,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the moment I can get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo looked at her father. &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> say that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head gravely, and told her again to go to the schoolroom. On
      the first landing she stopped, and looked back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be good, papa,&rdquo; she
      said&mdash;and went on up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached the schoolroom, she became the object of many questions&mdash;not
      one of which she answered. Followed by the dog, she sat down in a corner.
      &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; her sister inquired. This time she was
      willing to reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about Carmina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee closed the door when Zo left him. He took a chair, without
      speaking to his wife or looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you here for?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must wait,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see what you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marceline returned, and administered a dose of sal volatile. Strengthened
      by the stimulant, Mrs. Gallilee was able to rise. &ldquo;My head is giddy,&rdquo; she
      said, as she took the maid&rsquo;s arm; &ldquo;but I think I can get downstairs with
      your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee silently followed them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the stairs the giddiness increased. Firm as her resolution
      might be, it gave way before the bodily injury which Mrs. Gallilee had
      received. Her husband&rsquo;s help was again needed to take her to her bedroom.
      She stopped them at the ante-chamber; still obstinately bent on following
      her own designs. &ldquo;I shall be better directly,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;put me on the
      sofa.&rdquo; Marceline relieved her of her bonnet and veil, and asked
      respectfully if there was any other service required. She looked defiantly
      at her husband, and reiterated the order&mdash;&ldquo;Send for Joseph.&rdquo;
       Intelligent resolution is sometimes shaken; the inert obstinacy of a weak
      creature, man or animal, is immovable. Mr. Gallilee dismissed the maid
      with these words: &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t wait, my good girl&mdash;I&rsquo;ll speak to
      Joseph myself, downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife heard him with amazement and contempt. &ldquo;Are you in your right
      senses?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused on his way out. &ldquo;You were always hard and headstrong,&rdquo; he said
      sadly; &ldquo;I knew that. A cleverer man than I am might&mdash;I suppose it&rsquo;s
      possible&mdash;a clear-headed man might have found out how wicked you
      are.&rdquo; She lay, thinking; indifferent to anything he could say to her. &ldquo;Are
      you not ashamed?&rdquo; he asked wonderingly. &ldquo;And not even sorry?&rdquo; She paid no
      heed to him. He left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending to the hall, he was met by Joseph. &ldquo;Doctor Benjulia has come
      back, sir. He wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Joseph; I have something to say to you. If your mistress asks where
      they have taken Miss Carmina, you mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;this is my order, Joseph&mdash;you
      mustn&rsquo;t tell her. If you have mentioned it to any of the other servants&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      quite likely they may have asked you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said, falling into his
      old habit for a moment. &ldquo;If you have mentioned it to the others,&rdquo; he
      resumed, <i>&ldquo;they</i> mustn&rsquo;t tell her. That&rsquo;s all, my good man; that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his own surprise, Joseph found himself regarding his master with a
      feeling of respect. Mr. Gallilee entered the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; he asked, eager for news of Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worse for being moved,&rdquo; Benjulia replied. &ldquo;What about your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Answering that question, Mr. Gallilee mentioned the precautions that he
      had taken to keep the secret of Teresa&rsquo;s address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need be under no anxiety about that,&rdquo; said Benjulia. &ldquo;I have left
      orders that Mrs. Gallilee is not to be admitted. There is a serious
      necessity for keeping her out. In these cases of partial catalepsy, there
      is no saying when the change may come. When it does come, I won&rsquo;t answer
      for her niece&rsquo;s reason, if those two see each other again. Send for you
      own medical man. The girl is his patient, and he is the person on whom the
      responsibility rests. Let the servant take my card to him directly. We can
      meet in consultation at the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote a line on one of his visiting cards. It was at once sent to Mr.
      Null.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another matter to be settled before I go,&rdquo; Benjulia proceeded.
      &ldquo;Here are some papers, which I have received from your lawyer, Mr. Moot.
      They relate to a slander, which your wife unfortunately repeated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee got up from his chair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take my mind back to that&mdash;pray
      don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he pleaded earnestly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it, Doctor Benjulia&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t bear it! Please to excuse my rudeness: it isn&rsquo;t intentional&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know myself what&rsquo;s the matter with me. I&rsquo;ve always led a quiet life,
      sir; I&rsquo;m not fit for such things as these. Don&rsquo;t suppose I speak
      selfishly. I&rsquo;ll do what I can, if you will kindly spare me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He might as well have appealed to the sympathy of the table at which they
      were sitting. Benjulia was absolutely incapable of understanding the state
      of mind which those words revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you take these papers to your wife?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I called here this
      evening&mdash;being the person to blame&mdash;to set the matter right. As
      it is, I leave her to make the discovery for herself. I desire to hold no
      more communication with your wife. Have you anything to say to me before I
      go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one thing. Is there any harm in my calling at the house, to ask how
      poor Carmina goes on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask as often as you like&mdash;provided Mrs. Gallilee doesn&rsquo;t accompany
      you. If she&rsquo;s obstinate, it may not be amiss to give your wife a word of
      warning. In my opinion, the old nurse is not likely to let her off, next
      time, with her life. I&rsquo;ve had a little talk with that curious foreign
      savage. I said, &lsquo;You have committed, what we consider in England, a
      murderous assault. If Mrs. Gallilee doesn&rsquo;t mind the public exposure, you
      may find yourself in a prison.&rsquo; She snapped her fingers in my face.
      &lsquo;Suppose I find myself with the hangman&rsquo;s rope round my neck,&rsquo; she said,
      &lsquo;what do I care, so long as Carmina is safe from her aunt?&rsquo; After that
      pretty answer, she sat down by her girl&rsquo;s bedside, and burst out crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee listened absently: his mind still dwelt on Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I asked you to take her out of this house.
      It&rsquo;s no wonder if <i>I</i> was wrong. What I am too stupid to understand
      is&mdash;why <i>you</i> allowed her to be moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia listened with a grim smile; Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s presumption amused
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether there was any room left for memory, when nature
      furnished your narrow little head,&rdquo; he answered pleasantly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say
      that moving her was the least of two risks? And haven&rsquo;t I just warned you
      of what might have happened, if we had left your wife and her niece
      together in the same house? When I do a thing at my time of life, Mr.
      Gallilee&mdash;don&rsquo;t think me conceited&mdash;I know why I do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was speaking of himself in these terms, he might have said
      something more. He might have added, that his dread of the loss of
      Carmina&rsquo;s reason really meant his dread of a commonplace termination to an
      exceptionally interesting case. He might also have acknowledged, that he
      was not yielding obedience to the rules of professional etiquette, in
      confiding the patient to her regular medical attendant, but following the
      selfish suggestions of his own critical judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His experience, brief as it had been, had satisfied him that stupid Mr.
      Null&rsquo;s course of action could be trusted to let the instructive progress
      of the malady proceed. Mr. Null would treat the symptoms in perfect good
      faith&mdash;without a suspicion of the nervous hysteria which, in such a
      constitution as Carmina&rsquo;s, threatened to establish itself, in course of
      time, as the hidden cause. These motives&mdash;not only excused, but even
      ennobled, by their scientific connection with the interests of Medical
      Research&mdash;he might have avowed, under more favourable circumstances.
      While his grand discovery was still barely within reach, Doctor Benjulia
      stood committed to a system of diplomatic reserve, which even included
      simple Mr. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat and stick, and walked out into the hall. &ldquo;Can I be of
      further use?&rdquo; he asked carelessly. &ldquo;You will hear about the patient from
      Mr. Null.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t desert Carmina?&rdquo; said Mr. Gallilee. &ldquo;You will see her yourself,
      from time to time&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; I&rsquo;ll look after her.&rdquo; He spoke sincerely in saying this.
      Carmina&rsquo;s case had already suggested new ideas. Even the civilised savage
      of modern physiology (where his own interests are concerned) is not
      absolutely insensible to a feeling of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee opened the door for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the-bye,&rdquo; he added, as he stepped out, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s become of Zo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s upstairs, in the schoolroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made one of his dreary jokes. &ldquo;Tell her, when she wants to be tickled
      again, to let me know. Good-evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee returned to the upper part of the house, with the papers left
      by Benjulia in his hand. Arriving at the dressing-room door, he hesitated.
      The papers were enclosed in a sealed envelope, addressed to his wife.
      Secured in this way from inquisitive eyes, there was no necessity for
      personally presenting them. He went on to the schoolroom, and beckoned to
      the parlour-maid to come out, and speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having instructed her to deliver the papers&mdash;telling her mistress
      that they had been left at the house by Doctor Benjulia&mdash;he dismissed
      the woman from duty. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t return,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after the
      children myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria was busy with her book; and even idle Zo was employed!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was writing at her own inky desk; and she looked up in confusion, when
      her father appeared. Unsuspicious Mr. Gallilee took if for granted that
      his favourite daughter was employed on a writing lesson&mdash;following
      Maria&rsquo;s industrious example for once. &ldquo;Good children!&rdquo; he said, looking
      affectionately from one to the other. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t disturb you; go on.&rdquo; He
      took a chair, satisfied&mdash;comforted, even&mdash;to be in the same room
      with the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had placed himself nearer to the desk, he might have seen that Zo
      had been thinking of Carmina to some purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could she do to make her friend and playfellow well and happy again?
      There was the question which Zo asked herself, after having seen Carmina
      carried insensible out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessed of that wonderful capacity for minute observation of the elder
      persons about them, which is one among the many baffling mysteries
      presented by the minds of children, Zo had long since discovered that the
      member of the household, preferred to all others by Carmina, was the good
      brother who had gone away and left them. In his absence, she was always
      talking of him&mdash;and Zo had seen her kiss his photograph before she
      put it back in the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dwelling on these recollections, the child&rsquo;s slowly-working mental process
      arrived more easily than usual at the right conclusion. The way to make
      Carmina well and happy again, was to bring Ovid back. One of the two
      envelopes which he had directed for her still remained&mdash;waiting for
      the letter which might say to him, &ldquo;Come home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo determined to write that letter&mdash;and to do it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have confided this design to her father (the one person besides
      Carmina who neither scolded her nor laughed at her) if Mr. Gallilee had
      distinguished himself by his masterful position in the house. But she had
      seen him, as everybody else had seen him, &ldquo;afraid of mamma.&rdquo; The doubt
      whether he might not &ldquo;tell mamma,&rdquo; decided her on keeping her secret. As
      the event proved, the one person who informed Ovid of the terrible
      necessity that existed for his return, was the little sister whom it had
      been his last kind effort to console when he left England.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Gallilee entered the room, Zo had just reached the end of her
      letter. Her system of composition excluded capitals and stops; and reduced
      all the words in the English language, by a simple process of abridgment,
      to words of one syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;dear ov you come back car is ill she wants you be quick be quick don&rsquo;t
      say I writ this miss min is gone I hate books I like you zo.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the pen still in her hand, the wary writer looked round at her
      father. She had her directed envelope (sadly crumpled) in her pocket; but
      she was afraid to take it out. &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;would know what to
      do in my place. Horrid Maria!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortune, using the affairs of the household as an instrument, befriended
      Zo. In a minute more her opportunity arrived. The parlour-maid
      unexpectedly returned. She addressed Mr. Gallilee with the air of mystery
      in which English servants, in possession of a message, especially delight.
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, Joseph wishes to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the etiquette of the servants&rsquo; hall&mdash;which did not permit
      Joseph to present himself, voluntarily, in the regions above the
      drawing-room, without being first represented by an ambassadress&mdash;attention
      was now diverted from the children. Zo folded her letter, enclosed it in
      the envelope, and hid it in her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph appeared. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, I don&rsquo;t quite know whether I
      ought to disturb my mistress. Mr. Le Frank has called, and asked if he can
      see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee consulted the parlour-maid. &ldquo;Was your mistress asleep when I
      sent you to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. She told me to bring her a cup of tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On those rare former occasions, when Mrs. Gallilee had been ill, her
      attentive husband never left it to the servants to consult her wishes.
      That time had gone by for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your mistress, Joseph, that Mr. Le Frank is here.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The slander on which Mrs. Gallilee had reckoned, as a means of separating
      Ovid and Carmina, was now a slander refuted by unanswerable proof. And the
      man whose exertions had achieved this result, was her own lawyer&mdash;the
      agent whom she had designed to employ, in asserting that claim of the
      guardian over the ward which Teresa had defied.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a necessary consequence, the relations between Mr. Mool and herself
      were already at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she lay helpless&mdash;her authority set at naught; her person
      outraged by a brutal attack&mdash;there she lay, urged to action by every
      reason that a resolute woman could have for asserting her power, and
      avenging her wrong&mdash;without a creature to take her part, without an
      accomplice to serve her purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got on her feet, with the resolution of despair. Her heart sank&mdash;the
      room whirled round her&mdash;she dropped back on the sofa. In a recumbent
      position, the giddiness subsided. She could ring the hand-bell on the
      table at her side. &ldquo;Send instantly for Mr. Null,&rdquo; she said to the maid.
      &ldquo;If he is out, let the messenger follow him, wherever he may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The messenger came back with a note. Mr. Null would call on Mrs. Gallilee
      as soon as possible. He was then engaged in attendance on Miss Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that discovery, Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s last reserves of independent resolution
      gave way. The services of her own medical attendant were only at her
      disposal, when Carmina had done with him! At the top of his letter the
      address, which she had thus far tried vainly to discover, stared her in
      the face: the house was within five minutes&rsquo; walk&mdash;and she was not
      even able to cross the room! For the first time in her life, Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s imperious spirit acknowledged defeat. For the first time in her
      life, she asked herself the despicable question: Who can I find to help
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph&rsquo;s voice answered her. &ldquo;Mr. Le Frank has called, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;and
      wishes to know if you can see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She never stopped to think. She never even sent for the maid to see to her
      personal appearance. The horror of her own helplessness drove her on. Here
      was the man, whose timely betrayal of Carmina had stopped her on her way
      to Ovid, in the nick of time! Here was the self-devoted instrument,
      waiting to be employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Mr. Le Frank,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Show him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music-master looked round the obscurely lit room, and bowed to the
      recumbent figure on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I disturb you, madam, at an inconvenient time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am suffering from illness, Mr. Le Frank; but I am able to receive you&mdash;as
      you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped there. Now, when she saw him, and heard him, some perverse
      hesitation in her began to doubt him. Now, when it was too late, she
      weakly tried to put herself on her guard. What a decay of energy (she felt
      it herself) in the ready and resolute woman, equal to any emergency at
      other times! &ldquo;To what am I to attribute the favour of your visit?&rdquo; she
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even her voice failed her: it faltered in spite of her efforts to steady
      it. Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s vanity drew its own encouraging conclusion from this
      one circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am anxious to know how I stand in your estimation,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Early
      this evening, I left a few lines here, enclosing a letter&mdash;with my
      compliments. Have you received the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee hesitated. Mr. Le Frank smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trouble you, madam, for any more direct reply,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will
      speak plainly. Be so good as to tell me plainly, on your side, which I am&mdash;a
      man who has disgraced himself by stealing a letter? or a man who has
      distinguished himself by doing you a service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unpleasant alternative, neatly defined! To disavow Mr. Le Frank or to
      use Mr. Le Frank&mdash;there was the case for Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s
      consideration. She was incapable of pronouncing judgment; the mere effort
      of decision, after what she had suffered, fatigued and irritated her. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t deny,&rdquo; she said, with weary resignation, &ldquo;that you have done me a
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and made a generous return for the confidence that had been
      placed in him&mdash;he repeated his magnificent bow, and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our position towards each other seems too plain to be mistaken,&rdquo; he
      proceeded. &ldquo;Your niece&rsquo;s letter&mdash;perfectly useless for the purpose
      with which I opened it&mdash;offers me a means of being even with Miss
      Carmina, and a chance of being useful to You. Shall I begin by keeping an
      eye on the young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that said, Mr. Le Frank, out of devotion to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My devotion to you might wear out,&rdquo; he answered audaciously. &ldquo;You may
      trust my feeling towards your niece to last&mdash;I never forget an
      injury. Is it indiscreet to inquire how you mean to keep Miss Carmina from
      joining her lover in Quebec? Does a guardian&rsquo;s authority extend to locking
      her up in her room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee felt the underlying familiarity in these questions&mdash;elaborately
      concealed as it was under an assumption of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece is no longer in my house,&rdquo; she answered coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; cried Mr. Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      She corrected the expression. &ldquo;Removed,&rdquo; she said, and dropped the subject
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank took the subject up again. &ldquo;Removed, I presume, under the
      care of her nurse?&rdquo; he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse? What did he know about the nurse? &ldquo;May I ask&mdash;?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Gallilee began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled indulgently, and stopped her there. &ldquo;You are not quite yourself
      to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Permit me to remind you that your niece&rsquo;s letter to
      Mr. Ovid Vere is explicit, and that I took the liberty of reading it
      before I left it at your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee listened in silence, conscious that she had committed
      another error. She had carefully excluded from her confidence a man who
      was already in possession of her secrets! Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s courteous
      sympathy forbade him to take advantage of the position of superiority
      which he now held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do myself the honour of calling again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you are
      better able to place the right estimate on my humble offers of service. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t fatigue you, Mrs. Gallilee, for the world! At the same time,
      permit me to put one last question which ought not to be delayed. When
      Miss Carmina left you, did she take away her writing-desk and her keys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to suggest that she may send for them at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before it was possible to ask for an explanation, Joseph presented himself
      again. Mr. Null was waiting downstairs. Mrs. Gallilee arranged that he
      should be admitted when she rang her bell. Mr. Le Frank approached the
      sofa, when they were alone, and returned to his suggestion in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, you see the importance of using your niece&rsquo;s keys?&rdquo; he resumed.
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what correspondence may have been going on, in which the
      nurse and the governess have been concerned. After we have already
      intercepted a letter, hesitation is absurd! You are not equal to the
      effort yourself. I know the room. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of discovery; I have a
      naturally soft footfall&mdash;and my excuse is ready, if somebody else has
      a soft footfall too. Leave it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lit a candle as he spoke. But for that allusion to the nurse, Mrs.
      Gallilee might have ordered him to blow it out again. Eager for any
      discovery which might, by the barest possibility, place Teresa at her
      mercy, she silently submitted to Mr. Le Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call to-morrow,&rdquo; he
      said&mdash;and slipped out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Null was announced, Mrs. Gallilee pushed up the shade over the
      globe of the lamp. Her medical attendant&rsquo;s face might be worth observing,
      under a clear light.
    </p>
    <p>
      His timid look, his confused manner, when he made the conventional
      apologies, told her at once that Teresa had spoken, and that he knew what
      had happened. Even he had never before been so soothing and so attentive.
      But he forgot, or he was afraid, to consult appearances by asking what was
      the matter, before he felt the pulse, and took the temperature, and wrote
      his prescription. Not a word was uttered by Mrs. Gallilee, until the
      medical formalities came to an end. &ldquo;Is there anything more that I can
      do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I shall be well again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null was polite; Mr. Null was sympathetic. Mrs. Gallilee might be
      herself again in a day or two&mdash;or Mrs. Gallilee might be unhappily
      confined to her room for some little time. He had hope in his
      prescription, and hope in perfect quiet and repose&mdash;he would suggest
      the propriety of going to bed at once, and would not fail to call early
      the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down again,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null turned pale. He foresaw what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been in attendance on Miss Carmina. I wish to know what her
      illness is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null began to prevaricate at the outset. &ldquo;The case causes us serious
      anxiety. The complications are formidable. Doctor Benjulia himself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In plain words, Mr. Null, can she be moved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This produced a definite answer. &ldquo;Quite impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She only ventured to put her next question after waiting a little to
      control herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that foreign woman, the nurse&mdash;the only nurse&mdash;in
      attendance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of her, Mrs. Gallilee! A dreadful woman; coarse, furious, a
      perfect savage. When I suggested a second nurse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. You asked just now if you could do anything for me. You can
      do me a great service&mdash;you can recommend me a trustworthy lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null was surprised. As the old medical attendant of the family, he was
      not unacquainted with the legal adviser. He mentioned Mr. Mool&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mool has forfeited my confidence,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee announced. &ldquo;Can you,
      or can you not, recommend a lawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly! My own lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find writing materials on the table behind me. I won&rsquo;t keep you
      more than five minutes. I want you to write from my dictation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lady, in your present condition&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as I tell you! My head is quiet while I lie down. Even a woman in my
      condition can say what she means to do. I shall not close my eyes tonight,
      unless I can feel that I have put that wretch in her right place. Who are
      your lawyers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null mentioned the names, and took up his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Introduce me in the customary form,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee proceeded; &ldquo;and then
      refer the lawyers to my brother&rsquo;s Will. Is it done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In due time it was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them next, how my niece has been taken away from me, and where she
      has been taken to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the best of his ability, Mr. Null complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee, &ldquo;write what I mean to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prospect of being revenged on Teresa revived her. For the moment, at
      least, she almost looked like herself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null turned over to a new leaf, with a hand that trembled a little.
      The dictating voice pronounced these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid the woman Teresa to act in the capacity of nurse to Miss
      Carmina, and even to enter the room in which that young lady is now lying
      ill. I further warn this person, that my niece will be restored to my
      care, the moment her medical attendants allow her to be removed. And I
      desire my legal advisers to assert my authority, as guardian, to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null finished his task in silent dismay. He took out his handkerchief
      and wiped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any very terrible effort required in saying those few words&mdash;even
      to a shattered creature like me?&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee asked bitterly. &ldquo;Let me
      hear that the lawyers have got their instructions, when you come
      to-morrow; and give me the name and address of a nurse whom you can
      thoroughly recommend. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, Mr. Null got away. As he softly closed the dressing-room door,
      the serious question still dwelt on his mind: What would Teresa do?

      Even in the welcome retirement of the school-room, Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s mind was
      not at ease. He was troubled by a question entirely new to him&mdash;the
      question of himself, in the character of husband and father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed through long years of conjugal association to look up to his
      wife as a superior creature, he was now conscious that her place in his
      estimation had been lost, beyond recovery. If he considered next what
      ought to be done with Maria and Zo, he only renewed his perplexity and
      distress. To leave them (as he had hitherto left them) absolutely
      submitted to their mother&rsquo;s authority, was to resign his children to the
      influence of a woman, who had ceased to be the object of his confidence
      and respect. He pondered over it in the schoolroom; he pondered over it
      when he went to bed. On the next morning, he arrived at a conclusion in
      the nature of a compromise. He decided on applying to his good friend, Mr.
      Mool, for a word of advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first proceeding was to call at Teresa&rsquo;s lodgings, in the hope of
      hearing better news of Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melancholy report of her was expressed in two words: No change. He was
      so distressed that he asked to see the landlady; and tried, in his own
      helpless kindhearted way, to get a little hopeful information by asking
      questions&mdash;useless questions, repeated over and over again in futile
      changes of words. The landlady was patient: she respected the undisguised
      grief of the gentle modest old man; but she held to the hard truth. The
      one possible answer was the answer which her servant had already given.
      When she followed him out, to open the door, Mr. Gallilee requested
      permission to wait a moment in the hall. &ldquo;If you will allow me, ma&rsquo;am,
      I&rsquo;ll wipe my eyes before I go into the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the office without an appointment, he found the lawyer
      engaged. A clerk presented to him a slip of paper, with a line written by
      Mr. Mool: &ldquo;Is it anything of importance?&rdquo; Simple Mr. Gallilee wrote back:
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no; it&rsquo;s only me! I&rsquo;ll call again.&rdquo; Besides his critical
      judgment in the matter of champagne, this excellent man possessed another
      accomplishment&mdash;a beautiful handwriting. Mr. Mool, discovering a
      crooked line and some ill-formed letters in the reply, drew his own
      conclusions. He sent word to his old friend to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes more they were together, and the lawyer was informed of the
      events that had followed the visit of Benjulia to Fairfield Gardens, on
      the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while, the two men sat silently meditating&mdash;daunted by the
      prospect before them. When the time came for speaking, they exercised an
      influence over each other, of which both were alike unconscious. Out of
      their common horror of Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s conduct, and their common interest
      in Carmina, they innocently achieved between them the creation of one
      resolute man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Gallilee, this is a very serious thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mool, I feel it so&mdash;or I shouldn&rsquo;t have disturbed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of disturbing me! I see so many complications ahead of us, I
      hardly know where to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just my case! It&rsquo;s a comfort to me that you feel it as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool rose and tried walking up and down his room, as a means of
      stimulating his ingenuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this poor young lady,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;If she gets better&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it in that way!&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee interposed. &ldquo;It sounds as if you
      doubted her ever getting well&mdash;you see it yourself in that light,
      don&rsquo;t you? Be a little more positive, Mool, in mercy to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Mr. Mool agreed. &ldquo;Let us say, <i>when</i> she gets better.
      But the difficulty meets us, all the same. If Mrs. Gallilee claims her
      right, what are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee rose in his turn, and took a walk up and down the room. That
      well-meant experiment only left him feebler than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What possessed her brother to make her Carmina&rsquo;s guardian?&rdquo; he asked&mdash;with
      the nearest approach to irritability of which he was capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was busy with his own thoughts. He only enlightened Mr.
      Gallilee after the question had been repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the sincerest regard for Mr. Robert Graywell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A better
      husband and father&mdash;and don&rsquo;t let me forget it, a more charming
      artist&mdash;never lived. But,&rdquo; said Mr. Mool, with the air of one
      strong-minded man appealing to another: &ldquo;weak, sadly weak. If you will
      allow me to say so, your wife&rsquo;s self-asserting way&mdash;well, it was so
      unlike her brother&rsquo;s way, that it had its effect on him! If Lady Northlake
      had been a little less quiet and retiring, the matter might have ended in
      a very different manner. As it was (I don&rsquo;t wish to put the case
      offensively) Mrs. Gallilee imposed on him&mdash;and there she is, in
      authority, under the Will. Let that be. We must protect this poor girl. We
      must act!&rdquo; cried Mr. Mool with a burst of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must act!&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee repeated&mdash;and feebly clenched his fist,
      and softly struck the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have an idea,&rdquo; the lawyer proceeded; &ldquo;suggested by something
      said to me by Miss Carmina herself. May I ask if you are in her
      confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s face brightened at this. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
      always kiss her when we say good-night, and kiss her again when we say
      good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proof of his friend&rsquo;s claims as Carmina&rsquo;s chosen adviser, seemed
      rather to surprise Mr. Mool. &ldquo;Did she ever hint at an idea of hastening
      her marriage?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plainly as the question was put, it thoroughly puzzled Mr. Gallilee. His
      honest face answered for him&mdash;he was <i>not</i> in Carmina&rsquo;s
      confidence. Mr. Mool returned to his idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one thing we can do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to hasten Mr. Ovid&rsquo;s return. There
      is the only course to take&mdash;as I see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it at once!&rdquo; cried Mr. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; Mr. Mool insisted, greedy for encouragement&mdash;&ldquo;does my
      suggestion relieve your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first happy moment I&rsquo;ve had to-day!&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s weak voice
      piped high: he was getting firmer and firmer with every word he uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them produced a telegraph-form; the other seized a pen. &ldquo;Shall we
      send the message in your name?&rdquo; Mr. Mool asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Gallilee had possessed a hundred names he would have sent them (and
      paid for them) all. &ldquo;John Gallilee, 14 Fairfield Gardens, London, To&mdash;&rdquo;
       There the pen stopped. Ovid was still in the wilds of Canada. The one way
      of communicating with him was through the medium of the bankers at Quebec,
      To the bankers, accordingly, the message was sent. &ldquo;Please telegraph Mr.
      Ovid Vere&rsquo;s address, the moment you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the telegram had been sent to the office, an interval of inaction
      followed. Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s fortitude suffered a relapse. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time
      to wait,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend agreed with him. Morally speaking, Mr. Mool&rsquo;s strength lay in
      points of law. No point of law appeared to be involved in the present
      conference: he shared Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s depression of spirits. &ldquo;We are quite
      helpless,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;till Mr. Ovid comes back. In the interval, I see
      no choice for Miss Carmina but to submit to her guardian; unless&mdash;&rdquo;
       He looked hard at Mr. Gallilee, before he finished his sentence. &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo;
       he resumed, &ldquo;you can get over your present feeling about your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get over it?&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems quite impossible now, I dare say,&rdquo; the worthy lawyer admitted.
      &ldquo;A very painful impression has been produced on you. Naturally! naturally!
      But the force of habit&mdash;a married life of many years&mdash;your own
      kind feeling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gallilee, bewildered, impatient, almost
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little persuasion on your part, my good friend&mdash;at the interesting
      moment of reconciliation&mdash;might be followed by excellent results.
      Mrs. Gallilee might not object to waive her claims, until time has
      softened existing asperities. Surely, a compromise is possible, if you
      could only prevail on yourself to forgive your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive her? I should be only too glad to forgive her!&rdquo; cried Mr.
      Gallilee, bursting into violent agitation. &ldquo;How am I to do it? Good God!
      Mool, how am I to do it? <i>You</i> didn&rsquo;t hear those infamous words. <i>You</i>
      didn&rsquo;t see that dreadful death-struck look of the poor girl. I declare to
      you I turn cold when I think of my wife! I can&rsquo;t go to her when I ought to
      go&mdash;I send the servants into her room. My children, too&mdash;my dear
      good children&mdash;it&rsquo;s enough to break one&rsquo;s heart&mdash;think of their
      being brought up by a mother who could say what she said, and do&mdash;What
      will they see, I ask you what will they see, if she gets Carmina back in
      the house, and treats that sweet young creature as she <i>will</i> treat
      her? There were times last night, when I thought of going away for ever&mdash;Lord
      knows where&mdash;and taking the girls with me. What am I talking about? I
      had something to say, and I don&rsquo;t know what it is; I don&rsquo;t know my own
      self! There, there; I&rsquo;ll keep quiet. It&rsquo;s my poor stupid head, I suppose&mdash;hot,
      Mool, burning hot. Let&rsquo;s be reasonable. Yes, yes, yes; let&rsquo;s be
      reasonable. You&rsquo;re a lawyer. I said to myself, when I came here, &lsquo;I want
      Mool&rsquo;s advice.&rsquo; Be a dear good fellow&mdash;set my mind at ease. Oh, my
      friend, my old friend, what can I do for my children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amazed and distressed&mdash;utterly at a loss how to interfere to any good
      purpose&mdash;Mr. Mool recovered his presence of mind, the moment Mr.
      Gallilee appealed to him in his legal capacity. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress yourself
      about your children,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;Thank God, we stand on firm ground,
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean it, Mool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it. Where your daughters are concerned, the authority is yours. Be
      firm, Gallilee! be firm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will! You set me the example&mdash;don&rsquo;t you? <i>You&rsquo;re</i> firm&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Firm as a rock. I agree with you. For the present at least, the children
      must be removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once, Mool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once!&rdquo; the lawyer repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had wrought each other up to the right pitch of resolution, by this
      time. They were almost loud enough for the clerks to hear them in the
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what my wife may say!&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee stipulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what she may say,&rdquo; Mr. Mool rejoined, &ldquo;the father is master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>you</i> know the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know the law. You have only to assert yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>you</i> have only to back me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your children&rsquo;s sake, Gallilee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under my lawyer&rsquo;s advice, Mool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The one resolute Man was produced at last&mdash;without a flaw in him
      anywhere. They were both exhausted by the effort. Mr. Mool suggested a
      glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee ventured on a hint. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to have a drop of
      champagne handy?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer rang for his housekeeper. In five minutes, they were pledging
      each other in foaming tumblers. In five minutes more, they plunged back
      into business. The question of the best place to which the children could
      be removed, was easily settled. Mr. Mool offered his own house;
      acknowledging modestly that it had perhaps one drawback&mdash;it was
      within easy reach of Mrs. Gallilee. The statement of this objection
      stimulated his friend&rsquo;s memory. Lady Northlake was in Scotland. Lady
      Northlake had invited Maria and Zo, over and over again, to pass the
      autumn with their cousins; but Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s jealousy had always
      contrived to find some plausible reason for refusal. &ldquo;Write at once,&rdquo; Mr.
      Mool advised. &ldquo;You may do it in two lines. Your wife is ill; Miss Carmina
      is ill; you are not able to leave London&mdash;and the children are pining
      for fresh air.&rdquo; In this sense, Mr. Gallilee wrote. He insisted on having
      the letter sent to the post immediately. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s long before
      post-time,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;But I want to compose my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer paused, with his glass of wine at his lips. &ldquo;I say! You&rsquo;re not
      hesitating already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you are,&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will really send the girls away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls shall go, on the day when Lady Northlake invites them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a note of that,&rdquo; said Mr. Mool.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made the note; and they rose to say good-bye. Faithful Mr. Gallilee
      still thought of Carmina. &ldquo;Do consider it again!&rdquo; he said at parting. &ldquo;Are
      you sure the law won&rsquo;t help her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might look at her father&rsquo;s Will,&rdquo; Mr. Mool replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee saw the hopeful side of this suggestion, in the brightest
      colours. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you think of it before?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool gently remonstrated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget how many things I have on my
      mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It only occurs to me now that the Will may give us a
      remedy&mdash;if there is any <i>open</i> opposition to the ward&rsquo;s marriage
      engagement, on the guardian&rsquo;s part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he stopped; knowing Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s methods of opposition too well
      to reckon hopefully on such a result as this. But he was a merciful man&mdash;and
      he kept his misgivings to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home, Mr. Gallilee encountered his wife&rsquo;s maid. Marceline was
      dropping a letter into the pillar-post-box at the corner of the Square;
      she changed colour, on seeing her master. &ldquo;Corresponding with her
      sweetheart,&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the house with an unfinished cigar in his mouth, he made straight
      for the smoking-room&mdash;and passed his youngest daughter, below him,
      waiting out of sight on the kitchen stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done it?&rdquo; Zo whispered, when Marceline returned by the servants&rsquo; 
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe in the post, dear. Now tell me what you saw yesterday, when you
      were hidden in Miss Carmina&rsquo;s bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which she spoke implied a confidential agreement. With
      honourable promptitude Zo, perched on her friend&rsquo;s knee, exerted her
      memory, and rewarded Marceline for posting her letter to Ovid.

      CHAPTER XLIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was past the middle of the day, before Mr. Le Frank paid his promised
      visit to Mrs. Gallilee. He entered the room with gloomy looks; and made
      his polite inquiries, as became a depressed musician, in the minor key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, madam, to find you still on the sofa. Is there no improvement
      in your health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your medical attendant give you any hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does what they all do&mdash;he preaches patience. No more of myself!
      You appear to be in depressed spirits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank admitted with a sigh that appearances had not misrepresented
      him. &ldquo;I have been bitterly disappointed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My feelings as an
      artist are wounded to the quick. But why do I trouble you with my poor
      little personal affairs? I humbly beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes accompanied this modest apology with a look of uneasy
      anticipation: he evidently expected to be asked to explain himself. Events
      had followed her instructions to Mr. Null, which left Mrs. Gallilee in
      need of employing her music-master&rsquo;s services. She felt the necessity of
      exerting herself; and did it&mdash;with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no reason, I hope, to complain of your pupils?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this time of year, madam, I have no pupils. They are all out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was too deeply preoccupied by her own affairs to trouble herself any
      further. The direct way was the easy way. She said wearily, &ldquo;Well, what is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered in plain terms, this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bitter humiliation, Mrs. Gallilee! I have been made to regret that I
      asked you to honour me by accepting the dedication of my Song. The
      music-sellers, on whom the sale depends, have not taken a tenth part of
      the number of copies for which we expected them to subscribe. Has some
      extraordinary change come over the public taste? My composition has been
      carefully based on fashionable principles&mdash;that is to say, on the
      principles of the modern German school. As little tune as possible; and
      that little strictly confined to the accompaniment. And what is the
      result? Loss confronts me, instead of profit&mdash;my agreement makes me
      liable for half the expenses of publication. And, what is far more serious
      in my estimation, your honoured name is associated with a failure! Don&rsquo;t
      notice me&mdash;the artist nature&mdash;I shall be better in a minute.&rdquo; He
      took out a profusely-scented handkerchief, and buried his face in it with
      a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s hard common sense understood the heart-broken composer to
      perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid of me not to have offered him money yesterday,&rdquo; she thought: &ldquo;this
      waste of time need never have happened.&rdquo; She set her mistake right with
      admirable brevity and directness. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress yourself, Mr. Le Frank.
      Now my name is on it, the Song is mine. If your publisher&rsquo;s account is not
      satisfactory&mdash;be so good as to send it to <i>me.&rdquo;</i> Mr. Le Frank
      dropped his dry handkerchief, and sprang theatrically to his feet. His
      indulgent patroness refused to hear him: to this admirable woman, the
      dignity of Art was a sacred thing. &ldquo;Not a word more on that subject,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Tell me how you prospered last night. Your investigations cannot
      have been interrupted, or I should have heard of it. Come to the result!
      Have you found anything of importance in my niece&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank had again been baffled, so far as the confirmation of his own
      suspicions was concerned. But the time was not favourable to a confession
      of personal disappointment. He understood the situation; and made himself
      the hero of it, in three words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge for yourself,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and held out the letter of warning
      from Father Patrizio.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence, Mrs. Gallilee read the words which declared her to be the
      object of Teresa&rsquo;s inveterate resentment, and which charged Carmina with
      the serious duty of keeping the peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it alarm you?&rdquo; Mr. Le Frank asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know what I feel,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Give me time to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank went back to his chair. He had reason to congratulate himself
      already: he had shifted to other shoulders the pecuniary responsibility
      involved in the failure of his Song. Observing Mrs. Gallilee, he began to
      see possibilities of a brighter prospect still. Thus far she had kept him
      at a certain distance. Was the change of mind coming, which would admit
      him to the position (with all its solid advantages) of a confidential
      friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly took up Father Patrizio&rsquo;s letter, and showed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What impression does it produce on you,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;knowing no more than
      you know now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest&rsquo;s cautious language, madam, speaks for itself. You have an
      enemy who will stick at nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still hesitated to trust him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see me here,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;confined to my room; likely, perhaps, to
      be in this helpless condition for some time to come. How would you protect
      yourself against that woman, in my place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will allow me to use the language of the card-table, I should wait
      till the woman shows her hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>has</i> shown it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank said no more. If he was really wanted, Mrs. Gallilee had only
      to speak. After a last moment of hesitation, the pitiless necessities of
      her position decided her once more. &ldquo;You see me too ill to move,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;the first thing to do, is to tell you why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She related the plain facts; without a word of comment, without a sign of
      emotion. But her husband&rsquo;s horror of her had left an impression, which
      neither pride nor contempt had been strong enough to resist. She allowed
      the music-master to infer, that contending claims to authority over
      Carmina had led to a quarrel which provoked the assault. The secret of the
      words that she had spoken, was the one secret that she kept from Mr. Le
      Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I was insensible,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;my niece was taken away from me.
      She has been suffering from nervous illness; she was naturally terrified&mdash;and
      she is now at the nurse&rsquo;s lodgings, too ill to be moved. There you have
      the state of affairs, up to last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people might think,&rdquo; Mr. Le Frank remarked, &ldquo;that the easiest way
      out of it, so far, would be to summon the nurse for the assault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The easiest way compels me to face a public exposure,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee
      answered. &ldquo;In my position that is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank accepted this view of the case as a matter of course. &ldquo;Under
      the circumstances,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy to advise you. How can you
      make the woman submit to your authority, while you are lying here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lawyers have made her submit this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the extremity of his surprise, Mr. Le Frank forgot himself. &ldquo;The devil
      they have!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have forbidden her, in my name,&rdquo; Mrs. Gallilee continued, &ldquo;to act as
      nurse to my niece. They have informed her that Miss Carmina will be
      restored to my care, the moment she can be moved. And they have sent me
      her unconditional submission in writing, signed by herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took it from the desk at her side, and read it to him, in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I humbly ask pardon of Mrs. Gallilee for the violent and unlawful acts of
      which I have been guilty. I acknowledge, and submit to, her authority as
      guardian of Miss Carmina Graywell. And I appeal to her mercy (which I own
      I have not deserved) to spare me the misery of separation from Miss
      Carmina, on any conditions which it may be her good will and pleasure to
      impose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Mrs. Galilee concluded, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Speaking sincerely for once, Mr. Le Frank made a startling reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Submit on your side,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do what she asks of you. And when you are
      well enough to go to her lodgings, decline with thanks if she offers you
      anything to eat or drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee raised herself on the sofa. &ldquo;Are you insulting me, sir,&rdquo; she
      asked, &ldquo;by making this serious emergency the subject of a joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was more in earnest, madam, in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think&mdash;you really think&mdash;that she is capable of trying to
      poison me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee sank back on the pillow. Mr. Le Frank stated his reasons;
      checking them off, one by one, on his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;She is an Italian woman of the lower orders. The
      virtues of the people among whom she had been born and bred, are not
      generally considered to include respect for the sanctity of human life.
      What do we know already that she has done? She has alarmed the priest, who
      keeps her conscience, and knows her well; and she has attacked you with
      such murderous ferocity that it is a wonder you have escaped with your
      life. What sort of message have you sent to her, after this experience of
      her temper? You have told the tigress that you have the power to separate
      her from her cub, and that you mean to use it. On those plain facts, as
      they stare us in the face, which is the soundest conclusion? To believe
      that she really submits&mdash;or to believe that she is only gaining time,
      and is capable (if she sees no other alternative) of trying to poison
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you advise me to do?&rdquo; In those words Mrs. Gallilee&mdash;never
      before reduced to ask advice of anybody&mdash;owned that sound reasoning
      was not thrown away on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank answered the demand made on him without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nurse has not signed that act of submission,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without
      having her own private reasons for appearing to give way. Rely on it, she
      is prepared for you&mdash;and there is at least a chance that some proof
      of it may be found. Have all her movements privately watched&mdash;and
      search the room she lives in, as I searched Miss Carmina&rsquo;s room last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Mr. Le Frank repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She angrily gave way. &ldquo;Say at once that you are the man to do it for me!&rdquo;
       she answered. &ldquo;And say next&mdash;if you can&mdash;how it is to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s manner softened to an air of gentle gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray compose yourself!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am so glad to be of service to you,
      and it is so easily done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madam, quite easily. Isn&rsquo;t the house a lodging-house; and, at this
      time of year, have I anything to do?&rdquo; He rose, and took his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, you see me in my new character now? A single gentleman wants a
      bedroom. His habits are quiet, and he gives excellent references. The
      address, Mrs. Gallilee&mdash;may I trouble you for the address?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Towards seven o&rsquo;clock on the evening of Thursday, Carmina recognised
      Teresa for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her half-closed eyes opened, as if from a long sleep: they rested on the
      old nurse without any appearance of surprise. &ldquo;I am so glad to see you, my
      dear,&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;Are you very tired after you journey?&rdquo; None of
      the inquiries which might have been anticipated followed those first
      words. Not the slightest allusion to Mrs. Gallilee escaped her; she
      expressed no anxiety about Miss Minerva; no sign of uneasiness at finding
      herself in a. strange room, disturbed her quiet face. Contentedly
      reposing, she looked at Teresa from time to time and said, &ldquo;You will stay
      with me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Now and then, she confessed that her head felt dull
      and heavy, and asked Teresa to take her hand. &ldquo;I feel as if I was sinking
      away from you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;keep hold of my hand and I shan&rsquo;t be afraid to
      go to sleep.&rdquo; The words were hardly spoken, before she sank into slumber.
      Occasionally, Teresa felt her hand tremble and kissed it. She seemed to be
      conscious of the kiss, without waking&mdash;she smiled in her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when the first hours of the morning came, this state of passive
      repose was disturbed. A violent attack of sickness came on. It was
      repeated again and again. Teresa sent for Mr. Null. He did what he could
      to relieve the new symptom; and he despatched a messenger to his
      illustrious colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia lost no time in answering personally the appeal that had been
      made to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null said, &ldquo;Serious derangement of the stomach, sir.&rdquo; Benjulia agreed
      with him. Mr. Null showed his prescription. Benjulia sanctioned the
      prescription. Mr. Null said, &ldquo;Is there anything you wish to suggest, sir?&rdquo;
       Benjulia had nothing to suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, nevertheless, until Carmina was able to speak to him. Teresa
      and Mr. Null wondered what he would say to her. He only said, &ldquo;Do you
      remember when you last saw me?&rdquo; After a little consideration, she
      answered, &ldquo;Yes, Zo was with us; Zo brought in your big stick; and we
      talked&mdash;&rdquo; She tried to rouse her memory. &ldquo;What did we talk about?&rdquo;
       she asked. A momentary agitation brought a flush to her face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      remember it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember when you went away: does it
      matter?&rdquo; Benjulia replied, &ldquo;Not the least in the world. Go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he still remained in the room&mdash;watching her as she grew drowsy.
      &ldquo;Great weakness,&rdquo; Mr. Null whispered. And Benjulia answered, &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll
      call again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his way out, he took Teresa aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more questions,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t help her memory if she asks
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she remember, when she gets better?&rdquo; Teresa inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible to say, yet. Wait and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left her in a hurry; his experiments were waiting for him. On the way
      home, his mind dwelt on Carmina&rsquo;s case. Some hidden process was at work
      there: give it time&mdash;and it would show itself. &ldquo;I hope that ass won&rsquo;t
      want me,&rdquo; he said, thinking of his medical colleague, &ldquo;for at least a week
      to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The week passed&mdash;and the physiologist was not disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that interval, Mr. Null succeeded in partially overcoming the
      attacks of sickness: they were less violent, and they were succeeded by
      longer intervals of repose. In other respects, there seemed (as Teresa
      persisted in thinking) to be some little promise of improvement. A certain
      mental advance was unquestionably noticeable in Carmina. It first showed
      itself in an interesting way: she began to speak of Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her great anxiety was, that he should know nothing of her illness. She
      forbade Teresa to write to him; she sent messages to Mr. and Mrs.
      Gallilee, and even to Mr. Mool, entreating them to preserve silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse engaged to deliver the messages&mdash;and failed to keep her
      word. This breach of promise (as events had ordered it) proved to be
      harmless. Mrs. Gallilee had good reasons for not writing. Her husband and
      Mr. Mool had decided on sending their telegram to the bankers. As for
      Teresa herself, she had no desire to communicate with Ovid. His absence
      remained inexcusable, from her point of view. Well or ill, with or without
      reason, it was the nurse&rsquo;s opinion that he ought to have remained at home,
      in Carmina&rsquo;s interests. No other persons were in the least likely to write
      to Ovid&mdash;nobody thought of Zo as a correspondent&mdash;Carmina was
      pacified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice, at this later time, the languid efforts of her memory took
      a wider range.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered why Mrs. Gallilee never came near her; owning that her aunt&rsquo;s
      absence was a relief to her, but not feeling interest enough in the
      subject to ask for information. She also mentioned Miss Minerva. &ldquo;Do you
      know where she has gone? Don&rsquo;t you think she ought to write to me?&rdquo; Teresa
      offered to make inquiries. She turned her head wearily on the pillow, and
      said, &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; On another occasion, she asked for Zo, and said it
      would be pleasant if Mr. Gallilee would call and bring her with him. But
      she soon dropped the subject, not to return to it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only remembrance which seemed to dwell on her mind for more than a few
      minutes, was her remembrance of the last letter which she had written to
      Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pleased herself with imagining his surprise, when he received it; she
      grew impatient under her continued illness, because it delayed her in
      escaping to Canada; she talked to Teresa of the clever manner in which the
      flight had been planned&mdash;with this strange failure of memory, that
      she attributed the various arrangements for setting discovery at defiance,
      not to Miss Minerva, but to the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, for the first time, her mind was approaching dangerous ground. The
      stealing of the letter, and the events that had followed it, stood next in
      the order of remembrance&mdash;if she was capable of a continued effort.
      Her weakness saved her. Beyond the writing of the letter, her
      recollections were unable to advance. Not the faintest allusion to any
      later circumstances escaped her. The poor stricken brain still sought its
      rest in frequent intervals of sleep. Sometimes, she drifted back into
      partial unconsciousness; sometimes, the attacks of sickness returned. Mr.
      Null set an excellent example of patience and resignation. He believed as
      devoutly as ever in his prescriptions; he placed the greatest reliance on
      time and care. The derangement of the stomach (as he called it) presented
      something positive and tangible to treat: he had got over the doubts and
      anxieties that troubled him, when Carmina was first removed to the
      lodgings. Looking confidently at the surface&mdash;without an idea of what
      was going on below it&mdash;he could tell Teresa, with a safe conscience,
      that he understood the case. He was always ready to comfort her, when her
      excitable Italian nature passed from the extreme of hope to the extreme of
      despair. &ldquo;My good woman, we see our way now: it&rsquo;s a great point gained, I
      assure you, to see our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by seeing your way?&rdquo; said the downright nurse. &ldquo;Tell me
      when Carmina will be well again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null&rsquo;s medical knowledge was not yet equal to this demand on it. &ldquo;The
      progress is slow,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;still Miss Carmina is getting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is her aunt getting on?&rdquo; Teresa asked abruptly. &ldquo;When is Mistress
      Gallilee likely to come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few days&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Null was about to add &ldquo;I hope;&rdquo; but he thought
      of what might happen when the two women met. As it was, Teresa&rsquo;s face
      showed signs of serious disturbance: her mind was plainly not prepared for
      this speedy prospect of a visit from Mrs. Gallilee. She took a letter out
      of her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find a good deal of sly prudence in you,&rdquo; she said to Mr. Null. &ldquo;You
      must have seen something, in your time, of the ways of deceitful
      Englishwomen. What does that palaver mean in plain words?&rdquo; She handed the
      letter to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With some reluctance he read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gallilee declines to contract any engagement with the person
      formerly employed as nurse, in the household of the late Mr. Robert
      Graywell. Mrs. Gallilee so far recognises the apology and submission
      offered to her, as to abstain from taking immediate proceedings. In
      arriving at this decision, she is also influenced by the necessity of
      sparing her niece any agitation which might interfere with the medical
      treatment. When the circumstances appear to require it, she will not
      hesitate to exert her authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The handwriting told Mr. Null that this manifesto had not been written by
      Mrs. Gallilee herself. The person who had succeeded him, in the capacity
      of that lady&rsquo;s amanuensis, had been evidently capable of giving sound
      advice. Little did he suspect that this mysterious secretary was identical
      with an enterprising pianist, who had once prevailed on him to take a seat
      at a concert; price five shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse stamped impatiently on the floor. &ldquo;Tell me this! When she does
      come here, will she part me from Carmina? Is that what she means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said prudent Mr. Null.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa pointed to the door. &ldquo;Good-morning! I want nothing more of you. Oh,
      man, man, leave me by myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment she was alone, she fell on her knees. Fiercely whispering, she
      repeated over and over again the words of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer: &ldquo;&lsquo;Lead us not
      into temptation, but deliver us from evil.&rsquo; Christ, hear me! Mother of
      Christ, hear me! Oh, Carmina! Carmina!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and opened the door which communicated with the bedroom.
      Trembling pitiably, she looked for a while at Carmina, peacefully asleep&mdash;then
      turned away to a corner of the room, in which stood an old packing-case,
      fitted with a lock. She took it up; and, returning with it to the
      sitting-room, softly closed the bedroom door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some hesitation, she decided to open the case. In the terror and
      confusion that possessed her, she tried the wrong key. Setting this
      mistake right, she disclosed&mdash;strangely mingled with the lighter
      articles of her own dress&mdash;a heap of papers; some of them letters and
      bills; some of them faded instructions in writing for the preparation of
      artists&rsquo; colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recoiled from the objects which her own act had disclosed. Why had she
      not taken Father Patrizio&rsquo;s advice? If she had only waited another day; if
      she had only sorted her husband&rsquo;s papers, before she threw the things that
      her trunk was too full to hold into that half-empty case, what torment
      might have been spared to her! Her eyes turned mournfully to the bedroom
      door. &ldquo;Oh, my darling, I was in such a hurry to get to You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, she controlled herself, and put her hand into the case. Searching
      it in one corner, she produced a little tin canister. A dirty label was
      pasted on the canister, bearing this quaint inscription in the Italian
      language:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is any of the powder we employ in making some of our prettiest
      colours, left in here, I request my good wife, or any other trustworthy
      person in her place, to put a seal on it, and take it directly to the
      manufactory, with the late foreman&rsquo;s best respects. It looks like nice
      sugar. Beware of looks&mdash;or you may taste poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the point of opening the canister she hesitated. Under some strange
      impulse, she did what a child might have done: she shook it, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rustle of the rising and falling powder&mdash;renewing her terror&mdash;seemed
      to exercise some irresistible fascination over her. &ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s dance,&rdquo;
       she said to herself, with a ghastly smile. &ldquo;Softly up&mdash;and softly
      down&mdash;and tempting me to take off the cover all the time! Why don&rsquo;t I
      get rid of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That question set her thinking of Carmina&rsquo;s guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Null was right, in a day or two Mrs. Gallilee might come to the
      house. After the lawyers had threatened Teresa with the prospect of
      separation from Carmina, she had opened the packing-case, for the first
      time since she had left Rome&mdash;intending to sort her husband&rsquo;s papers
      as a means of relief from her own thoughts. In this way, she had
      discovered the canister. The sight of the deadly powder had tempted her.
      There were the horrid means of setting Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s authority at
      defiance! Some women in her place, would use them. Though she was not
      looking into the canister now, she felt that thought stealing back into
      her mind. There was but one hope for her: she resolved to get rid of the
      poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      How?
    </p>
    <p>
      At that period of the year, there was no fire in the grate. Within the
      limits of the room, the means of certain destruction were slow to present
      themselves. Her own morbid horror of the canister made her suspicious of
      the curiosity of other people, who might see it in her hand if she showed
      herself on the stairs. But she was determined, if she lit a fire for the
      purpose, to find the way to her end. The firmness of her resolution
      expressed itself by locking the case again, without restoring the canister
      to its hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providing herself next with a knife, she sat down in a corner&mdash;between
      the bedroom door on one side, and a cupboard in an angle of the wall on
      the other&mdash;and began the work of destruction by scraping off the
      paper label. The fragments might be burnt, and the powder (if she made a
      vow to the Virgin to do it) might be thrown into the fire next&mdash;and
      then the empty canister would be harmless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made but little progress in the work of scraping, when it occurred
      to her that the lighting of a fire, on that warm autumn day, might look
      suspicious if the landlady or Mr. Null happened to come in. It would be
      safer to wait till night-time, when everybody would be in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at this conclusion, she mechanically suspended the use of her
      knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the moment of silence that followed, she heard someone enter the
      bedroom by the door which opened on the stairs. Immediately afterwards,
      the person turned the handle of the second door at her side. She had
      barely time enough to open the cupboard, and hide the canister in it&mdash;when
      the landlady came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa looked at her wildly. The landlady looked at the cupboard: she was
      proud of her cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of room there,&rdquo; she said boastfully: &ldquo;not another house in the
      neighbourhood could offer you such accommodation as that! Yes&mdash;the
      lock is out of order; I don&rsquo;t deny it. The last lodger&rsquo;s doings! She
      spoilt my tablecloth, and put the inkstand over it to hide the place.
      Beast! there&rsquo;s her character in one word. You didn&rsquo;t hear me knock at the
      bedroom door? I am so glad to see her sleeping nicely, poor dear! Her
      chicken broth is ready when she wakes. I&rsquo;m late to-day in making my
      inquiries after our young lady. You see we have been hard at work
      upstairs, getting the bedroom ready for a new lodger. Such a contrast to
      the person who has just left. A perfect gentleman, this time&mdash;and so
      kind in waiting a week till I was able to accommodate him. My ground floor
      rooms were vacant, as you know&mdash;but he said the terms were too high
      for him. Oh, I didn&rsquo;t forget to mention that we had an invalid in the
      house! Quiet habits (I said) are indeed an essential qualification of any
      new inmate, at such a time as this. He understood. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been an invalid
      myself&rsquo; (he said); &lsquo;and the very reason I am leaving my present lodgings
      is that they are not quiet enough.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that just the sort of man we
      want? And, let me tell you, a handsome man too. With a drawback, I must
      own, in the shape of a bald head. But such a beard, and such a thrilling
      voice! Hush! Did I hear her calling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, the landlady permitted other sounds to be audible, besides the
      sound of her own voice. It became possible to discover that Carmina was
      now awake. Teresa hurried into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by herself in the sitting-room, the landlady&mdash;&ldquo;purely out of
      curiosity,&rdquo; as she afterwards said, in conversation with her new lodger&mdash;opened
      the cupboard, and looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canister stood straight before her, on an upper shelf. Did Miss
      Carmina&rsquo;s nurse take snuff? She examined the canister: there was a white
      powder inside. The mutilated label spoke in an unknown tongue. She wetted
      her finger and tasted the powder. The result was so disagreeable that she
      was obliged to use her handkerchief. She put the canister back, and closed
      the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medicine, undoubtedly,&rdquo; the landlady said to herself. &ldquo;Why should she
      hurry to put it away, when I came in?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In eight days from the date of his second interview with Mrs. Gallilee,
      Mr. Le Frank took possession of his new bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had arranged to report his proceedings in writing. In Teresa&rsquo;s state of
      mind, she would certainly distrust a fellow-lodger, discovered in personal
      communication with Mrs. Gallilee. Mr. Le Frank employed the first day
      after his arrival in collecting the materials for a report. In the
      evening, he wrote to Mrs. Gallilee&mdash;under cover to a friend, who was
      instructed to forward the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private and confidential. Dear Madam,&mdash;I have not wasted my time and
      my opportunities, as you will presently see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bedroom is immediately above the floor of the house which is occupied
      by Miss Carmina and her nurse. Having some little matters of my own to
      settle, I was late in taking possession of my room. Before the lights on
      the staircase were put out, I took the liberty of looking down at the next
      landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, when you were a child learning to write, that one of the
      lines in your copy-books was, &lsquo;Virtue is its own reward&rsquo;? This ridiculous
      assertion was actually verified in my case! Before I had been five minutes
      at my post, I saw the nurse open her door. She looked up the staircase
      (without discovering me, it is needless to say), and she looked down the
      staircase&mdash;and, seeing nobody about, returned to her rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting till I heard her lock the door, I stole downstairs, and listened
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of my two fellow-lodgers (you know that I don&rsquo;t believe in Miss
      Carmina&rsquo;s illness) was lighting a fire&mdash;on such a warm autumn night,
      that the staircase window was left open! I am absolutely sure of what I
      say: I heard the crackle of burning wood&mdash;I smelt coal smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The motive of this secret proceeding it seems impossible to guess at. If
      they were burning documents of a dangerous and compromising kind, a candle
      would have answered their purpose. If they wanted hot water, surely a tin
      kettle and a spirit lamp must have been at hand in an invalid&rsquo;s bedroom?
      Perhaps, your superior penetration may be able to read the riddle which
      baffles my ingenuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for the first night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon, I had some talk with the landlady. My professional
      avocations having trained me in the art of making myself agreeable to the
      sex, I may say without vanity that I produced a favourable impression. In
      other words, I contrived to set my fair friend talking freely about the
      old nurse and the interesting invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the flow of words poured on me, one fact of very serious
      importance has risen to the surface. There is a suspicious canister in the
      nurse&rsquo;s possession. The landlady calls the powder inside, medicine. I say,
      poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I rushing at a fanciful conclusion? Please wait a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the week of delay which elapsed, before the lodger in possession
      vacated my room, you kindly admitted me to an interview. I ventured to put
      some questions, relating to Teresa&rsquo;s life in Italy and to the persons with
      whom she associated. Do you remember telling me, when I asked what you
      knew of her husband, that he was foreman in a manufactory of artists&rsquo; 
      colours? and that you had your information from Miss Carmina herself,
      after she had shown you the telegram announcing his death?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady, possessed of your scientific knowledge, does not require to be
      told that poisons are employed in making artists&rsquo; colours. Remember what
      the priest&rsquo;s letter says of Teresa&rsquo;s feeling towards you, and then say&mdash;Is
      it so very unlikely that she has brought with her to England one of the
      poisons used by her husband in his trade? and is it quite unreasonable to
      suppose (when she looks at her canister) that she may be thinking of you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be right or I may be wrong. Thanks to the dilapidated condition of
      a lock, I can decide the question, at the first opportunity offered to me
      by the nurse&rsquo;s absence from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My next report shall tell you that I have contrived to provide myself
      with a sample of the powder&mdash;leaving the canister undisturbed. The
      sample shall be tested by a chemist. If he pronounces it to be poison, I
      have a bold course of action to propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you are well enough to go to the house, give the nurse her
      chance of poisoning you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madam, don&rsquo;t be alarmed! I will accompany you; and I will answer for
      the result. We will pay our visit at tea-time. Let her offer you a cup&mdash;and
      let me (under pretence of handing it) get possession of the poisoned
      drink. Before she can cry Stop!&mdash;I shall be on my way to the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The penalty for attempted murder is penal servitude. If you still object
      to a public exposure, we have the chemist&rsquo;s report, together with your own
      evidence, ready for your son on his return. How will he feel about his
      marriage-engagement, when he finds that Miss Carmina&rsquo;s dearest friend and
      companion has tried&mdash;<i>perhaps, with her young lady&rsquo;s knowledge</i>&mdash;to
      poison his mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before concluding, I may mention that I had a narrow escape, only two
      hours since, of being seen by Teresa on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was of course prepared for this sort of meeting, when I engaged my
      room; and I have therefore not been foolish enough to enter the house
      under an assumed name. On the contrary, I propose (in your interests) to
      establish a neighbourly acquaintance&mdash;with time to help me. But the
      matter of the poison admits of no delay. My chance of getting at it
      unobserved may be seriously compromised, if the nurse remembers that she
      first met with me in your house, and distrusts me accordingly. Your
      devoted servant, L. F.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having completed his letter, he rang for the maid, and gave it to her to
      post.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her way downstairs, she was stopped on the next landing by Mr. Null. He
      too had a letter ready: addressed to Doctor Benjulia. The fierce old nurse
      followed him out, and said, &ldquo;Post it instantly!&rdquo; The civil maid asked if
      Miss Carmina was better. &ldquo;Worse!&rdquo;&mdash;was all the rude foreigner said.
      She looked at poor Mr. Null, as if it was his fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left in the retirement of his room, Mr. Le Frank sat at the writing-table,
      frowning and biting his nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were these evidences of a troubled mind connected with the infamous
      proposal which he had addressed to Mrs. Gallilee? Nothing of the sort!
      Having sent away his letter, he was now at leisure to let his personal
      anxieties absorb him without restraint. He was thinking of Carmina. The
      oftener his efforts were baffled, the more resolute he became to discover
      the secret of her behaviour to him. For the hundredth time he said to
      himself, &ldquo;Her devilish malice reviles me behind my back, and asks me
      before my face to shake hands and be friends.&rdquo; The more outrageously
      unreasonable his suspicions became, under the exasperating influence of
      suspense, the more inveterately his vindictive nature held to its
      delusion. After meeting her in the hall at Fairfield Gardens, he really
      believed Carmina&rsquo;s illness to have been assumed as a means of keeping out
      of his way. If a friend had said to him, &ldquo;But what reason have you to
      think so?&rdquo;&mdash;he would have smiled compassionately, and have given that
      friend up for a shallow-minded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole out again, and listened, undetected, at their door. Carmina was
      speaking; but the words, in those faint tones, were inaudible. Teresa&rsquo;s
      stronger voice easily reached his ears. &ldquo;My darling, talking is not good
      for you. I&rsquo;ll light the night-lamp&mdash;try to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this, he went back to his bedroom to wait a little. Teresa&rsquo;s
      vigilance might relax if Carmina fell asleep. She might go downstairs for
      a gossip with the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      After smoking a cigar, he tried again. The lights on the staircase were
      now put out: it was eleven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not asleep: the nurse was reading to her from some devotional
      book. He gave it up, for that night. His head ached; the ferment of his
      own abominable thoughts had fevered him. A cowardly dread of the slightest
      signs of illness was one of his special weaknesses. The whole day,
      to-morrow, was before him. He felt his own pulse; and determined, in
      justice to himself, to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, the landlady, on her way to bed, ascended the stairs.
      She too heard the voice, still reading aloud&mdash;and tapped softly at
      the door. Teresa opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the poor thing not asleep yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she been disturbed in some way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody has been walking about, overhead,&rdquo; Teresa answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the new lodger!&rdquo; exclaimed the landlady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Mr. Le
      Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the point of closing the door, and saying good-night, Teresa stopped,
      and considered for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he your new lodger?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him when I was last in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more,&rdquo; Teresa answered. &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Watching through the night by Carmina&rsquo;s bedside, Teresa found herself
      thinking of Mr. Le Frank. It was one way of getting through the weary
      time, to guess at the motive which had led him to become a lodger in the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common probabilities pointed to the inference that he might have reasons
      for changing his residence, which only concerned himself. But common
      probabilities&mdash;from Teresa&rsquo;s point of view&mdash;did not apply to Mr.
      Le Frank. On meeting him, at the time of her last visit to England, his
      personal appearance had produced such a disagreeable impression on her,
      that she had even told Carmina &ldquo;the music-master looked like a rogue.&rdquo;
       With her former prejudice against him now revived, and with her serious
      present reasons for distrusting Mrs. Gallilee, she rejected the idea of
      his accidental presence under her landlady&rsquo;s roof. To her mind, the
      business of the new lodger in the house was, in all likelihood, the
      business of a spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Le Frank was warily laying his plans for the next day, he had
      himself become an object of suspicion to the very woman whose secrets he
      was plotting to surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the longest and saddest night which the faithful old nurse had
      passed at her darling&rsquo;s bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, Carmina was fretful, and hard to please: patient
      persuasion was needed to induce her to take her medicine. Even when she
      was thirsty, she had an irritable objection to being disturbed, if the
      lemonade was offered to her which she had relished at other times. Once or
      twice, when she drowsily stirred in her bed, she showed symptoms of
      delusion. The poor girl supposed it was the eve or her wedding-day, and
      eagerly asked what Teresa had done with her new dress. A little later,
      when she had perhaps been dreaming, she fancied that her mother was still
      alive, and repeated the long-forgotten talk of her childhood. &ldquo;What have I
      said to distress you?&rdquo; she asked wonderingly, when she found Teresa
      crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after sunrise, there came a long interval of repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the later time when Benjulia arrived, she was quiet and uncomplaining.
      The change for the worse which had induced Teresa to insist on sending for
      him, was perversely absent. Mr. Null expected to be roughly rebuked for
      having disturbed the great man by a false alarm. He attempted to explain:
      and Teresa attempted to explain. Benjulia paid not the slightest attention
      to either of them. He made no angry remarks&mdash;and he showed, in his
      own impenetrable way, as gratifying an interest in the case as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw up the blind,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I want to have a good look at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null waited respectfully, and imposed strict silence on Teresa, while
      the investigation was going on. It lasted so long that he ventured to say,
      &ldquo;Do you see anything particular, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia saw his doubts cleared up: time (as he had anticipated) had
      brought development with it, and had enabled him to arrive at a
      conclusion. The shock that had struck Carmina had produced complicated
      hysterical disturbance, which was now beginning to simulate paralysis.
      Benjulia&rsquo;s profound and practised observation detected a trifling
      inequality in the size of the pupils of the eyes, and a slightly unequal
      action on either side of the face&mdash;delicately presented in the
      eyelids, the nostrils, and the lips. Here was no common affection of the
      brain, which even Mr. Null could understand! Here, at last, was Benjulia&rsquo;s
      reward for sacrificing the precious hours which might otherwise have been
      employed in the laboratory! From that day, Carmina was destined to receive
      unknown honour: she was to take her place, along with the other animals,
      in his note-book of experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned quietly to Mr. Null, and finished the consultation in two words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to suggest, sir?&rdquo; Mr. Null inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with the treatment&mdash;and draw down the blind, if she complains
      of the light. Good-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure he&rsquo;s a great doctor?&rdquo; said Teresa, when the door had closed
      on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest we have!&rdquo; cried Mr. Null with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a good man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know if we can trust him to tell us the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doubt of it!&rdquo; (Who could doubt it, indeed, after he had approved of
      Mr. Null&rsquo;s medical treatment?)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you have forgotten,&rdquo; Teresa persisted. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
      asked him when Carmina can be moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good woman, if I had put such a question, he would have set me down as
      a fool! Nobody can say when she will be well enough to be moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat. The nurse followed him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to Mrs. Gallilee, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is almost well again.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Left alone, Teresa went into the sitting-room: she was afraid to show
      herself at the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null had destroyed the one hope which had supported her thus far&mdash;the
      hope of escaping from England with Carmina, before Mrs. Gallilee could
      interfere. Looking steadfastly at that inspiriting prospect, she had
      forced herself to sign the humble apology and submission which the lawyers
      had dictated. What was the prospect now? Heavily had the merciless hand of
      calamity fallen on that brave old soul&mdash;and, at last, it had beaten
      her down! While she stood at the window, mechanically looking out, the
      dreary view of the back street trembled and disappeared. Teresa was
      crying. Happily for herself, she was unable to control her own weakness;
      the tears lightened her heavy heart. She waited a little, in the fear that
      her eyes might betray her, before she returned to Carmina. In that
      interval, she heard the sound of a closing door, on the floor above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The music-master!&rdquo; she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant, she was at the sitting-room door, looking through the
      keyhole. It was the one safe way of watching him&mdash;and that was enough
      for Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      His figure appeared suddenly within her narrow range of view&mdash;on the
      mat outside the door. If her distrust of him was without foundation, he
      would go on downstairs. No! He stopped on the mat to listen&mdash;he
      stooped&mdash;his eye would have been at the keyhole in another moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seized a chair, and moved it. The sound instantly drove him away. He
      went on, down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa considered with herself what safest means of protection&mdash;and,
      if possible, of punishment as well&mdash;lay within her reach. How, and
      where, could the trap be set that might catch him?
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still puzzled by that question, when the landlady made her
      appearance&mdash;politely anxious to hear what the doctors thought of
      their patient. Satisfied so far, the wearisome woman had her apologies to
      make next, for not having yet cautioned Mr. Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking over it, since last night,&rdquo; she said confidentially, &ldquo;I cannot
      imagine how you heard him walking overhead. He has such a soft step that
      he positively takes me by surprise when he comes into my room. He has gone
      out for an hour; and I have done him a little favour which I am not in the
      habit of conferring on ordinary lodgers&mdash;I have lent him my umbrella,
      as it threatens rain. In his absence, I will ask you to listen while I
      walk about in his room. One can&rsquo;t be too particular, when rest is of such
      importance to your young lady&mdash;and it has struck me as just possible,
      that the floor of his room may be in fault. My dear, the boards may creak!
      I&rsquo;m a sad fidget, I know; but, if the carpenter can set things right&mdash;without
      any horrid hammering, of course!&mdash;the sooner he is sent for, the more
      relieved I shall feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through this harangue, the nurse had waited, with a patience far from
      characteristic of her, for an opportunity of saying a timely word. By some
      tortuous mental process, that she was quite unable to trace, the
      landlady&rsquo;s allusion to Mr. Le Frank had suggested the very idea of which,
      in her undisturbed solitude, she had been vainly in search. Never before,
      had the mistress of the house appeared to Teresa in such a favourable
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said, as soon as she could make
      herself heard; &ldquo;it <i>was</i> the creaking of the boards that told me
      somebody was moving overhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m not a fidget after all? Oh, how you relieve me! Whatever the
      servants may have to do, one of them shall be sent instantly to the
      carpenter. So glad to be of any service to that sweet young creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa consulted her watch before she returned to the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The improvement in Carmina still continued: she was able to take some of
      the light nourishment that was waiting for her. As Benjulia had
      anticipated, she asked to have the blind lowered a little. Teresa drew it
      completely over the window: she had her own reasons for tempting Carmina
      to repose. In half an hour more, the weary girl was sleeping, and the
      nurse was at liberty to set her trap for Mr. Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first proceeding was to dip the end of a quill pen into her bottle of
      salad oil, and to lubricate the lock and key of the door that gave access
      to the bedroom from the stairs. Having satisfied herself that the key
      could now be used without making the slightest sound, she turned to the
      door of communication with the sitting-room next.
    </p>
    <p>
      This door was covered with green baize. It had handles but no lock; and it
      swung inwards, so as to allow the door of the cupboard (situated in the
      angle of the sitting-room wall) to open towards the bedroom freely. Teresa
      oiled the hinges, and the brass bolt and staple which protected the baize
      door on the side of the bedroom. That done, she looked again at her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s absence was expected to last for an hour. In five minutes
      more, the hour would expire.
    </p>
    <p>
      After bolting the door of communication, she paused in the bedroom, and
      wafted a kiss to Carmina, still at rest. She left the room by the door
      which opened on the stairs, and locked it, taking away the key with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gone down the first flight of stairs, she stopped and went back.
      The one unsecured door, was the door which led into the sitting-room from
      the staircase. She opened it and left it invitingly ajar. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said
      to herself, &ldquo;the trap will catch him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hall clock struck the hour when she entered the landlady&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman of many words was at once charmed and annoyed. Charmed to hear
      that the dear invalid was resting, and to receive a visit from the nurse:
      annoyed by the absence of the carpenter, at work somewhere else for the
      whole of the day. &ldquo;If my dear husband had been alive, we should have been
      independent of carpenters; he could turn his hand to anything. Now do sit
      down&mdash;I want you to taste some cherry brandy of my own making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Teresa took a chair, Mr. Le Frank returned. The two secret adversaries
      met, face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I remember this lady?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa encountered him, on his own ground. She made her best curtsey, and
      reminded him of the circumstances under which they had formerly met. The
      hospitable landlady produced her cherry brandy. &ldquo;We are going to have a
      nice little chat; do sit down, sir, and join us.&rdquo; Mr. Le Frank made his
      apologies. The umbrella which had been so kindly lent to him, had not
      protected his shoes; his feet were wet; and he was so sadly liable to take
      cold that he must beg permission to put on his dry things immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having bowed himself out, he stopped in the passage, and, standing on
      tiptoe, peeped through a window in the wall, by which light was conveyed
      to the landlady&rsquo;s little room. The two women were comfortably seated
      together, with the cherry brandy and a plate of biscuits on a table
      between them. &ldquo;In for a good long gossip,&rdquo; thought Mr. Le Frank. &ldquo;Now is
      my time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not five minutes more had passed, before Teresa made an excuse for running
      upstairs again. She had forgotten to leave the bell rope, in case Carmina
      woke, within the reach of her hand. The excellent heart of the hostess
      made allowance for natural anxiety. &ldquo;Do it, you good soul,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
      come back directly!&rdquo; Left by herself, she filled her glass again, and
      smiled. Sweetness of temper (encouraged by cherry brandy) can even smile
      at a glass&mdash;unless it happens to be empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching her own rooms, Teresa waited, and listened, before she showed
      herself. No sound reached her through the half open sitting-room door. She
      noiselessly entered the bedroom, and then locked the door again. Once more
      she listened; and once more there was nothing to be heard. Had he seen her
      on the stairs?
    </p>
    <p>
      As the doubt crossed her mind, she heard the boards creak on the floor
      above. Mr. Le Frank was in his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did this mean that her well-laid plan had failed? Or did it mean that he
      was really changing his shoes and stockings? The last inference was the
      right one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made no mere excuse downstairs. The serious interests that he had
      at stake, were not important enough to make him forget his precious
      health. His chest was delicate; a cold might settle on his lungs. The
      temptation of the half-open door had its due effect on this prudent man;
      but it failed to make him forget that his feet were wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boards creaked again; the door of his room was softly closed&mdash;then
      there was silence. Teresa only knew when he had entered the sitting-room
      by hearing him try the bolted baize door. After that, he must have stepped
      out again. He next tried the door of the bedchamber, from the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a quiet interval once more. Teresa noiselessly drew back the
      bolt; and, opening the baize door by a mere hair&rsquo;s-breadth, admitted sound
      from the sitting-room. She now heard him turning the key in a chiffonier,
      which only contained tradesmen&rsquo;s circulars, receipted bills, and a few
      books.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Even with the canister in the cupboard, waiting to be opened, his
      uppermost idea was to discover Carmina&rsquo;s vindictive motive in Carmina&rsquo;s
      papers!)
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of the chiffonier disappointed him&mdash;judging by the tone
      in which he muttered to himself. The next sound startled Teresa; it was a
      tap against the lintel of the door behind which she was standing. He had
      thrown open the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rasping of the cover, as he took it off, told her that he was
      examining the canister. She had put it back on the shelf, a harmless thing
      now&mdash;the poison and the label having been both destroyed by fire.
      Nevertheless, his choosing the canister, from dozens of other things
      scattered invitingly about it, inspired her with a feeling of distrustful
      surprise. She was no longer content to find out what he was doing by means
      of her ears. Determined to see him, and to catch him in the fact, she
      pulled open the baize door&mdash;at the moment when he must have
      discovered that the canister was empty. A faint thump told her he had
      thrown it on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The view of the sitting-room was still hidden from her. She had forgotten
      the cupboard door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that it was wide open, it covered the entrance to the bedroom, and
      completely screened them one from the other. For the moment she was
      startled, and hesitated whether to show herself or not. His voice stopped
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there another canister?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;The dirty old savage may
      have hidden it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa heard no more. &ldquo;The dirty old savage&rdquo; was an insult not to be
      endured! She forgot her intention of stealing on him unobserved; she
      forgot her resolution to do nothing that could awaken Carmina. Her fierce
      temper urged her into furious action. With both hands outspread, she flew
      at the cupboard door, and banged it to in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shriek of agony rang through the house. The swiftly closing door had
      caught, and crushed, the fingers of Le Frank&rsquo;s right hand, at the moment
      when he was putting it into the cupboard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without stopping to help him, without even looking at him, she ran back to
      Carmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swinging baize door fell to, and closed of itself. No second cry was
      heard. Nothing happened to falsify her desperate assertion that the shriek
      was the delusion of a vivid dream. She took Carmina in her arms, and
      patted and fondled her like a child. &ldquo;See, my darling, I&rsquo;m with you as
      usual; and I have heard nothing. Don&rsquo;t, oh, don&rsquo;t tremble in that way!
      There&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wrap you up in my shawl, and read to you. No! let&rsquo;s talk
      of Ovid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her efforts to compose Carmina were interrupted by a muffled sound of
      men&rsquo;s footsteps and women&rsquo;s voices in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurriedly opened the door, and entreated them to whisper and be quiet.
      In the instant before she closed it again, she saw and heard. Le Frank lay
      in a swoon on the floor. The landlady was kneeling by him, looking at his
      injured hand; and the lodgers were saying, &ldquo;Send him to the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Monday morning, the strain on Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s powers of patient
      endurance came to an end. With the help of Mr. Null&rsquo;s arm, she was able to
      get downstairs to the library. On Tuesday, there would be no objection to
      her going out for a drive. Mr. Null left her, restored to her equable flow
      of spirits. He had asked if she wished to have somebody to keep her
      company&mdash;and she had answered briskly, &ldquo;Not on any account! I prefer
      being alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of Saturday, she had received Mr. Le Frank&rsquo;s letter; but
      she had not then recovered sufficiently to be able to read it through. She
      could now take it up again, and get to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other women might have been alarmed by the atrocious wickedness of the
      conspiracy which the music-master had planned. Mrs. Gallilee was only
      offended. That he should think her capable&mdash;in her social position&mdash;of
      favouring such a plot as he had suggested, was an insult which she was
      determined neither to forgive nor forget. Fortunately, she had not
      committed herself in writing; he could produce no proof of the relations
      that had existed between them. The first and best use to make of her
      recovery would be to dismiss him&mdash;after paying his expenses,
      privately and prudently, in money instead of by cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the man&rsquo;s insolence had left its revolting impression on
      her mind. The one way to remove it was to find some agreeable occupation
      for her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at your library table, learned lady, and take the appropriate means
      of relief that it offers. See the lively modern parasites that infest
      Science, eager to invite your attention to their little crawling selves.
      Follow scientific inquiry, rushing into print to proclaim its own
      importance, and to declare any human being, who ventures to doubt or
      differ, a fanatic or a fool. Respect the leaders of public opinion,
      writing notices of professors, who have made discoveries not yet tried by
      time, not yet universally accepted even by their brethren, in terms which
      would be exaggerated if they were applied to Newton or to Bacon. Submit to
      lectures and addresses by dozens which, if they prove nothing else, prove
      that what was scientific knowledge some years since; is scientific
      ignorance now&mdash;and that what is scientific knowledge now, may be
      scientific ignorance in some years more. Absorb your mind in controversies
      and discussions, in which Mr. Always Right and Mr. Never Wrong exhibit the
      natural tendency of man to believe in himself, in the most rampant stage
      of development that the world has yet seen. And when you have done all
      this, doubt not that you have made a good use of your time. You have
      discovered what the gentle wisdom of FARADAY saw and deplored, when he
      warned the science of his day in words which should live for ever: &ldquo;The
      first and last step in the education of the judgment is&mdash;Humility.&rdquo;
       Having agreeably occupied her mind with subjects that were worthy of it,
      Mrs. Gallilee rose to seek a little physical relief by walking up and down
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing and repassing the bookcases, she noticed a remote corner devoted
      to miscellaneous literature. A volume in faded binding of sky-blue, had
      been placed upside down. She looked at the book before she put it in its
      right position. The title was &ldquo;Gallery of British Beauty.&rdquo; Among the
      illustrations&mdash;long since forgotten&mdash;appeared her own portrait,
      when she was a girl of Carmina&rsquo;s age.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faintly contemptuous smile parted her hard lips, provoked by the
      recollections of her youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a fool she had been, at that early period of her life! In those days,
      she had trembled with pleasure at the singing of a famous Italian tenor;
      she had flown into a passion when a new dress proved to be a misfit, on
      the evening of a ball; she had given money to beggars in the street; she
      had fallen in love with a poor young man, and had terrified her
      weak-minded hysterical mother, by threatening to commit suicide when the
      beloved object was forbidden the house. Comparing the girl of seventeen
      with the matured and cultivated woman of later years, what a matchless
      example Mrs. Gallilee presented of the healthy influence of education,
      directed to scientific pursuits! &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she thought, as she put the book
      back in its place, &ldquo;my girls will have reason to thank me when they grow
      up; they have had a mother who has done her duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took a few more turns up and down the room. The sky had cleared again;
      a golden gleam of sunlight drew her to the window. The next moment she
      regretted even this concession to human weakness. A disagreeable
      association presented itself, and arrested the pleasant flow of her
      thoughts. Mr. Gallilee appeared on the door-step; leaving the house on
      foot, and carrying a large brown-paper parcel under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      With servants at his disposal, why was he carrying the parcel himself? The
      time had been, when Mrs. Gallilee would have tapped at the window, and
      would have insisted on his instantly returning and answering the question.
      But his conduct, since the catastrophe in Carmina&rsquo;s room, had produced a
      complete estrangement between the married pair. All his inquiries after
      his wife&rsquo;s health had been made by deputy. When he was not in the
      schoolroom with the children, he was at his club. Until he came to his
      senses, and made humble apology, no earthly consideration would induce
      Mrs. Gallilee to take the slightest notice of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to her reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman came in, with two letters&mdash;one arriving by post; the
      other having been dropped into the box by private messenger.
      Communications of this latter sort proceeded, not unfrequently, from
      creditors. Mrs. Gallilee opened the stamped letter first.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contained nothing more important than a few lines from a daily
      governess, whom she had engaged until a successor to Miss Minerva could be
      found. In obedience to Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s instructions, the governess would
      begin her attendance at ten o&rsquo;clock on the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second letter was of a very different kind. It related the disaster
      which had befallen Mr. Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null was the writer. As Miss Carmina&rsquo;s medical attendant, it was his
      duty to inform her guardian that her health had been unfavourably affected
      by an alarm in the house. Having described the nature of the alarm, he
      proceeded in these words: &ldquo;You will, I fear, lose the services of your
      present music-master. Inquiries made this morning at the hospital, and
      reported to me, appear to suggest serious results. The wounded man&rsquo;s
      constitution is in an unhealthy state; the surgeons are not sure of being
      able to save two of the fingers. I will do myself the honour of calling
      to-morrow before you go out for your drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impression produced by this intelligence on the lady to whom it was
      addressed, can only be reported in her own words. She&mdash;who knew, on
      the best scientific authority, that the world had created itself&mdash;completely
      lost her head, and actually said, &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For weeks to come&mdash;perhaps for months if the surgeons&rsquo; forebodings
      were fulfilled&mdash;Mrs. Gallilee had got rid of Mr. Le Frank. In that
      moment of infinite relief, if her husband had presented himself, it is
      even possible that he might have been forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, Mr. Gallilee returned late in the afternoon; entered his own
      domain of the smoking-room; and left the house again five minutes
      afterwards. Joseph officiously opened the door for him; and Joseph was
      surprised, precisely as his mistress had been surprised. Mr. Gallilee had
      a large brown paper parcel under his arm&mdash;the second which he had
      taken out of the house with his own hands! Moreover, he looked excessively
      confused when the footman discovered him. That night, he was late in
      returning from the club. Joseph (now on the watch) observed that he was
      not steady on his legs&mdash;and drew his own conclusions accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctual to her time, on the next morning, the new governess arrived. Mrs.
      Gallilee received her, and sent for the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid in charge of them appeared alone. She had no doubt that the young
      ladies would be back directly. The master had taken them out for a little
      walk, before they began their lessons. He had been informed that the lady
      who had been appointed to teach them would arrive at ten o&rsquo;clock. And what
      had he said? He had said, &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-hour struck&mdash;eleven o&rsquo;clock struck&mdash;and neither the
      father nor the children returned. Ten minutes later, someone rang the door
      bell. The door being duly opened, nobody appeared on the house-step.
      Joseph looked into the letter-box, and found a note addressed to his
      mistress, in his master&rsquo;s handwriting. He immediately delivered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, Mrs. Gallilee had only been anxious. Joseph, waiting for events
      outside the door, heard the bell rung furiously; and found his mistress
      (as he forcibly described it) &ldquo;like a woman gone distracted.&rdquo; Not without
      reason&mdash;to do her justice. Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s method of relieving his
      wife&rsquo;s anxiety was remarkable by its brevity. In one sentence, he assured
      her that there was no need to feel alarmed. In another, he mentioned that
      he had taken the girls away with him for a change of air. And then he
      signed his initials&mdash;J. G.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every servant in the house was summoned to the library, when Mrs. Gallilee
      had in some degree recovered herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One after another they were strictly examined; and one after another they
      had no evidence to give&mdash;excepting the maid who had been present when
      the master took the young ladies away. The little she had to tell, pointed
      to the inference that he had not admitted the girls to his confidence
      before they left the house. Maria had submitted, without appearing to be
      particularly pleased at the prospect of so early a walk. Zo (never ready
      to exert either her intelligence or her legs) had openly declared that she
      would rather stay at home. To this the master had answered, &ldquo;Get your
      things on directly!&rdquo;&mdash;and had said it so sharply that Miss Zoe stared
      at him in astonishment. Had they taken anything with them&mdash;a
      travelling bag for instance? They had taken nothing, except Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s
      umbrella. Who had seen Mr. Gallilee last, on the previous night? Joseph
      had seen him last. The lower classes in England have one, and but one,
      true feeling of sympathy with the higher classes. The man above them
      appeals to their hearts, and merits their true service, when he is
      unsteady on his legs. Joseph nobly confined his evidence to what he had
      observed some hours previously: he mentioned the parcel. Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s
      keen perception, quickened by her own experience at the window, arrived at
      the truth. Those two bulky packages must have contained clothes&mdash;left,
      in anticipation of the journey, under the care of an accomplice. It was
      impossible that Mr. Gallilee could have got at the girls&rsquo; dresses and
      linen, and have made the necessary selections from them, without a woman&rsquo;s
      assistance. The female servants were examined again. Each one of them
      positively asserted her innocence. Mrs. Gallilee threatened to send for
      the police. The indignant women all cried in chorus, &ldquo;Search our boxes!&rdquo;
       Mrs. Gallilee took a wiser course. She sent to the lawyers who had been
      recommended to her by Mr. Null. The messenger had just been despatched,
      when Mr. Null himself, in performance of yesterday&rsquo;s engagement, called at
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, was agitated. It was impossible that he could have heard what had
      happened. Was he the bearer of bad news? Mrs. Gallilee thought of Carmina
      first, and then of Mr. Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prepare for a surprise,&rdquo; Mr. Null began, &ldquo;a joyful surprise, Mrs.
      Gallilee! I have received a telegram from your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed it to her as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;September 6th. Arrived at Quebec, and received information of Carmina&rsquo;s
      illness. Shall catch the Boston steamer, and sail to-morrow for Liverpool.
      Break the news gently to C. For God&rsquo;s sake send telegram to meet me at
      Queenstown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then the 7th of September. If all went well, Ovid might be in
      London in ten days more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee read the telegram&mdash;paused&mdash;and read it again. She
      let it drop on her lap; but her eyes still rested mechanically on the slip
      of paper. When she spoke, her voice startled Mr. Null. Usually loud and
      hard, her tones were strangely subdued. If his back had been turned
      towards her, he would hardly have known who was speaking to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask you to make allowances for me,&rdquo; she began, abruptly; &ldquo;I hardly
      know what to say. This surprise comes at a time when I am badly prepared
      for it. I am getting well; but, you see, I am not quite so strong as I was
      before that woman attacked me. My husband has gone away&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
      where&mdash;and has taken my children with him. Read his note: but don&rsquo;t
      say anything. You must let me be quiet, or I can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She handed the letter to Mr. Null. He looked at her&mdash;read the few
      words submitted to him&mdash;and looked at her again. For once, his stock
      of conventional phrases failed him. Who could have anticipated such
      conduct on the part of her husband? Who could have supposed that she
      herself would have been affected in this way, by the return of her son?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee drew a long heavy breath. &ldquo;I have got it now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My
      son is coming home in a hurry because of Carmina&rsquo;s illness. Has Carmina
      written to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null was in his element again: this question appealed to his knowledge
      of his patient. &ldquo;Impossible, Mrs. Gallilee&mdash;in her present state of
      health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her present state of health? I forgot that. There was something else.
      Oh, yes! Has Carmina seen the telegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null explained. He had just come from Carmina. In his medical
      capacity, he had thought it judicious to try the moral effect on his
      patient of a first allusion to the good news. He had only ventured to say
      that Mr. Ovid&rsquo;s agents in Canada had heard from him on his travels, and
      had reason to believe that he would shortly return to Quebec. Upon the
      whole, the impression produced on the young lady&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to go on. Mrs. Gallilee was pursuing her own thoughts,
      without even the pretence of listening to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know who wrote to my son,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;Was it the nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null considered this to be in the last degree unlikely. The nurse&rsquo;s
      language showed a hostile feeling towards Mr. Ovid, in consequence of his
      absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee looked once more at the telegram. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;does
      Ovid telegraph to You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null answered with his customary sense of what was due to himself. &ldquo;As
      the medical attendant of the family, your son naturally supposed, madam,
      that Miss Carmina was under my care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The implied reproof produced no effect. &ldquo;I wonder whether my son was
      afraid to trust us?&rdquo; was all Mrs. Gallilee said. It was the chance guess
      of a wandering mind&mdash;but it had hit the truth. Kept in ignorance of
      Carmina&rsquo;s illness by the elder members of the family, at what other
      conclusion could Ovid arrive, with Zo&rsquo;s letter before him? After a
      momentary pause, Mrs. Gallilee went on. &ldquo;I suppose I may keep the
      telegram?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prudent Mr. Null offered a copy&mdash;and made the copy, then and there.
      The original (he explained) was his authority for acting on Mr. Ovid&rsquo;s
      behalf, and he must therefore beg leave to keep it. Mrs. Gallilee
      permitted him to exchange the two papers. &ldquo;Is there anything more?&rdquo; she
      asked. &ldquo;Your time is valuable of course. Don&rsquo;t let me detain you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I feel your pulse before I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her arm to him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage came to the door while he was counting the beat of the pulse.
      She glanced at the window, and said, &ldquo;Send it away.&rdquo; Mr. Null
      remonstrated. &ldquo;My dear lady, the air will do you good.&rdquo; She answered
      obstinately and quietly, &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;and once more became absorbed in
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been her intention to combine her first day of carriage exercise
      with a visit to Teresa&rsquo;s lodgings, and a personal exertion of her
      authority. The news of Ovid&rsquo;s impending return made it a matter of serious
      importance to consider this resolution under a new light. She had now, not
      only to reckon with Teresa, but with her son. With this burden on her
      enfeebled mind&mdash;heavily laden by the sense of injury which her
      husband&rsquo;s flight had aroused&mdash;she had not even reserves enough of
      energy to spare for the trifling effort of dressing to go out. She broke
      into irritability, for the first time. &ldquo;I am trying to find out who has
      written to my son. How can I do it when you are worrying me about the
      carriage? Have you ever held a full glass in your hand, and been afraid of
      letting it overflow? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of&mdash;in my mind&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t mean that my mind is a glass&mdash;I mean&mdash;&rdquo; Her forehead
      turned red. <i>&ldquo;Will</i> you leave me?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change in her manner, the difficulty she found in expressing her
      thoughts, had even startled stupid Mr. Null. She had herself alluded to
      results of the murderous attack made on her by Teresa, which had not
      perhaps hitherto sufficiently impressed him. In the shock inflicted on the
      patient&rsquo;s body, had there been involved some subtly-working influence that
      had disturbed the steady balance of her mind? Pondering uneasily on that
      question, he spoke to Joseph in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know about your master and the children?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had told me of it, when you let me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I done any harm, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. If you want me, I shall be at home to dinner at seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next visitor was one of the partners in the legal firm, to which Mrs.
      Gallilee had applied for advice. After what Mr. Null had said, Joseph
      hesitated to conduct this gentleman into the presence of his mistress. He
      left the lawyer in the waiting-room, and took his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s attitude had not changed. She sat looking down at the
      copied telegram and the letter from her husband, lying together on her
      lap. Joseph was obliged to speak twice, before he could rouse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time shall I say, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand to her head&mdash;and broke into anger against Joseph.
      &ldquo;Settle it yourself, you wretch!&rdquo; Her head drooped again over the papers.
      Joseph returned to the lawyer. &ldquo;My mistress is not very well, sir. She
      will be obliged if you will call to-morrow, at your own time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About an hour later, she rang her bell&mdash;rang it unintermittingly,
      until Joseph appeared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m famished,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Something to eat! I
      never was so hungry in my life. At once&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook sent up a cold fowl, and a ham. Her eyes devoured the food, while
      the footman was carving it for her. Her bad temper seemed to have
      completely disappeared. She said, &ldquo;What a delicious dinner! Just the very
      things I like.&rdquo; She lifted the first morsel to her mouth&mdash;and laid
      the fork down again with a weary sigh. &ldquo;No: I can&rsquo;t eat; what has come to
      me?&rdquo; With those words, she pushed her chair away from the table, and
      looked slowly all round her. &ldquo;I want the telegram and the letter.&rdquo; Joseph
      found them. &ldquo;Can you help me?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am trying to find out who
      wrote my son. Say yes, or no, at once; I hate waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph left her in her old posture, with her head down and the papers on
      her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the uneaten dinner in the kitchen produced a discussion,
      followed by a quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph was of the opinion that the mistress had got more upon her mind
      than her mind could well bear. It was useless to send for Mr. Null; he had
      already mentioned that he would not be home until seven o&rsquo;clock.. There
      was no superior person in the house to consult. It was not for the
      servants to take responsibility on themselves. &ldquo;Fetch the nearest doctor,
      and let <i>him</i> be answerable, if anything serious happens.&rdquo; Such was
      Joseph&rsquo;s advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women (angrily remembering that Mrs. Gallilee had spoken of sending
      for the police) ridiculed the footman&rsquo;s cautious proposal&mdash;with one
      exception. When the others ironically asked him if he was not accustomed
      to the mistress&rsquo;s temper yet, Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s own maid (Marceline) said,
      &ldquo;What do we know about it? Joseph is the only one of us who has seen her,
      since the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This perfectly sensible remark had the effect of a breath of wind on a
      smouldering fire. The female servants, all equally suspected of having
      assisted Mr. Gallilee in making up his parcels, were all equally assured
      that there was a traitress among them&mdash;and that Marceline was the
      woman. Hitherto suppressed, this feeling now openly found its way to
      expression. Marceline lost her temper; and betrayed herself as her
      master&rsquo;s guilty confederate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mean mongrel&mdash;am I?&rdquo; cried the angry maid, repeating the
      cook&rsquo;s allusion to her birthplace in the Channel Islands. &ldquo;The mistress
      shall know, this minute, that I&rsquo;m the woman who did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so before?&rdquo; the cook retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I promised my master not to tell on him, till he got to his
      journey&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll lay a wager?&rdquo; asked the cook. &ldquo;I bet half-a-crown she changes her
      mind, before she gets to the top of the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she thinks the mistress will forgive her,&rdquo; the parlour-maid
      suggested ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perhaps,&rdquo; the housemaid added, &ldquo;she means to give the mistress notice
      to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m going to do!&rdquo; said Marceline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women all declined to believe her. She appealed to Joseph. &ldquo;What did I
      tell you, when the mistress first sent me out in the carriage with poor
      Miss Carmina? Didn&rsquo;t I say that I was no spy, and that I wouldn&rsquo;t submit
      to be made one? I would have left the house&mdash;I would!&mdash;but for
      Miss Carmina&rsquo;s kindness. Any other young lady would have made me feel my
      mean position. <i>She</i> treated me like a friend&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
      forget it. I&rsquo;ll go straight from this place, and help to nurse her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that declaration, Marceline left the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the library door, she paused. Not as the cook had suggested, to
      &ldquo;change her mind;&rdquo; but to consider beforehand how much she should confess
      to her mistress, and how much she should hold in reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo&rsquo;s narrative of what had happened, on the evening of Teresa&rsquo;s arrival,
      had produced its inevitable effect on the maid&rsquo;s mind. Strengthening, by
      the sympathy which it excited, her grateful attachment to Carmina, it had
      necessarily intensified her dislike of Mrs. Gallilee&mdash;and Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s innocent husband had profited by that circumstance!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unexpectedly tried by time, Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s resolution to assert his
      paternal authority, in spite of his wife, had failed him. The same
      timidity which invents a lie in a hurry, can construct a stratagem at
      leisure. Marceline had discovered her master putting a plan of escape,
      devised by himself, to its first practical trial before the open wardrobe
      of his daughters&mdash;and had asked slyly if she could be of any use.
      Never remarkable for presence of mind in emergencies, Mr. Gallilee had
      helplessly admitted to his confidence the last person in the house, whom
      anyone else (in his position) would have trusted. &ldquo;My good soul, I want to
      take the girls away quietly for change of air&mdash;you have got little
      secrets of your own, like me, haven&rsquo;t you?&mdash;and the fact is, I don&rsquo;t
      quite know how many petticoats&mdash;.&rdquo; There, he checked himself;
      conscious, when it was too late, that he was asking his wife&rsquo;s maid to
      help him in deceiving his wife. The ready Marceline helped him through the
      difficulty. &ldquo;I understand, sir: my mistress&rsquo;s mind is much occupied&mdash;and
      you don&rsquo;t want to trouble her about this little journey.&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee, at
      a loss for any other answer, pulled out his purse. Marceline modestly drew
      back at the sight of it. &ldquo;My mistress pays me, sir; I serve <i>you</i> for
      nothing.&rdquo; In those words, she would have informed any other man of the
      place which Mrs. Gallilee held in her estimation. Her master simply
      considered her to be the most disinterested woman he had ever met with. If
      she lost her situation through helping him, he engaged to pay her wages
      until she found another place. The maid set his mind at rest on that
      subject. &ldquo;A woman who understands hairdressing as I do, sir, can refer to
      other ladies besides Mrs. Gallilee, and can get a place whenever she wants
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having decided on what she should confess, and on what she should conceal,
      Marceline knocked at the library door. Receiving no answer, she went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee was leaning back in her chair: her hands hung down on either
      side of her; her eyes looked up drowsily at the ceiling. Prepared to see a
      person with an overburdened mind, the maid (without sympathy, to quicken
      her perceptions) saw nothing but a person on the point of taking a nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak a word, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s eyes remained fixed on the ceiling. &ldquo;Is that my maid?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treated&mdash;to all appearance&mdash;with marked contempt, Marceline no
      longer cared to assume the forms of respect either in language or manner.
      &ldquo;I wish to give you notice to leave,&rdquo; she said abruptly; &ldquo;I find I can&rsquo;t
      get on with my fellow-servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee slowly raised her head, and looked at her maid&mdash;and
      said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while I&rsquo;m about it,&rdquo; the angry woman proceeded, &ldquo;I may as well own
      the truth. You suspect one of us of helping my master to take away the
      young ladies&rsquo; things&mdash;I mean some few of their things. Well! you
      needn&rsquo;t blame innocent people. I&rsquo;m the person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee laid her head back again on the chair&mdash;and burst out
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one moment, Marceline looked at her mistress in blank surprise. Then,
      the terrible truth burst on her. She ran into the hall, and called for
      Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried up the stairs. The instant he presented himself at the open
      door, Mrs. Gallilee rose to her feet. &ldquo;My medical attendant,&rdquo; she said,
      with an assumption of dignity; &ldquo;I must explain myself.&rdquo; She held up one
      hand, outstretched; and counted her fingers with the other. &ldquo;First my
      husband. Then my son. Now my maid. One, two, three. Mr. Null, do you know
      the proverb? &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the last hair that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back.&rsquo;&rdquo; She
      suddenly dropped on her knees. &ldquo;Will somebody pray for me?&rdquo; she cried
      piteously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to pray for myself. Where is God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bareheaded as he was, Joseph ran out. The nearest doctor lived on the
      opposite side of the Square. He happened to be at home. When he reached
      the house, the women servants were holding their mistress down by main
      force.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the next day, Mr. Mool&mdash;returning from a legal consultation to an
      appointment at his office&mdash;found a gentleman, whom he knew by sight,
      walking up and down before his door; apparently bent on intercepting him.
      &ldquo;Mr. Null, I believe?&rdquo; he said, with his customary politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null answered to his name, and asked for a moment of Mr. Mool&rsquo;s time.
      Mr. Mool looked grave, and said he was late for an appointment already.
      Mr. Null admitted that the clerks in the office had told him so, and said
      at last, what he ought to have said at first: &ldquo;I am Mrs. Gallilee&rsquo;s
      medical attendant&mdash;there is serious necessity for communicating with
      her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool instantly led the way into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief clerk approached his employer, with some severity of manner.
      &ldquo;The parties have been waiting, sir, for more than a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
       Mr. Mool&rsquo;s attention wandered: he was thinking of Mrs. Gallilee. &ldquo;Is she
      dying?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She is out of her mind,&rdquo; Mr. Null answered. Those words
      petrified the lawyer: he looked helplessly at the clerk&mdash;who, in his
      turn, looked indignantly at the office clock. Mr. Mool recovered himself.
      &ldquo;Say I am detained by a most distressing circumstance; I will call on the
      parties later in the day, at their own hour.&rdquo; Giving those directions to
      the clerk, he hurried Mr. Null upstairs into a private room. &ldquo;Tell me
      about it; pray tell me about it. Stop! Perhaps, there is not time enough.
      What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null put the question, which he ought to have asked when they met at
      the house door. &ldquo;Can you tell me Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly! Care of the Earl of Northlake&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please write it in my pocket-book? I am so upset by this
      dreadful affair that I can&rsquo;t trust my memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such a confession of helplessness as this, was all that was wanted to
      rouse Mr. Mool. He rejected the pocket-book, and wrote the address on a
      telegram. &ldquo;Return directly: your wife is seriously ill.&rdquo; In five minutes
      more, the message was on its way to Scotland; and Mr. Null was at liberty
      to tell his melancholy story&mdash;if he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      With assistance from Mr. Mool, he got through it. &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; he
      proceeded, &ldquo;I have had the two best opinions in London. Assuming that
      there is no hereditary taint, the doctors think favourably of Mrs.
      Gallilee&rsquo;s chances of recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it violent madness?&rdquo; Mr. Mool asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null admitted that two nurses were required. &ldquo;The doctors don&rsquo;t look
      on her violence as a discouraging symptom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are inclined to
      attribute it to the strength of her constitution. I felt it my duty to
      place my own knowledge of the case before them. Without mentioning painful
      family circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happen to be acquainted with the circumstances,&rdquo; Mr. Mool interposed.
      &ldquo;Are they in any way connected with this dreadful state of things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put that question eagerly, as if he had some strong personal interest
      in hearing the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null blundered on steadily with his story. &ldquo;I thought it right (with
      all due reserve) to mention that Mrs. Gallilee had been subjected to&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t trouble you with medical language&mdash;let us say, to a severe
      shock; involving mental disturbance as well as bodily injury, before her
      reason gave way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they considered that to be the cause&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null asserted his dignity. &ldquo;The doctors agreed with Me, that it had
      shaken her power of self-control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You relieve me, Mr. Null&mdash;you infinitely relieve me! If our way of
      removing the children had done the mischief, I should never have forgiven
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blushed, and said no more. Had Mr. Null noticed the slip of the tongue
      into which his agitation had betrayed him? Mr. Null did certainly look as
      if he was going to put a question. The lawyer desperately forestalled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask how you came to apply to me for Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s address? Did you
      think of it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null had never had an idea of his own, from the day of his birth,
      downward. &ldquo;A very intelligent man,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;reminded me that you
      were an old friend of Mr. Gallilee. In short, it was Joseph&mdash;the
      footman at Fairfield Gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph&rsquo;s good opinion was of no importance to Mr. Mool&rsquo;s professional
      interests. He could gratify Mr. Null&rsquo;s curiosity without fear of lowering
      himself in the estimation of a client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better, perhaps, explain that chance allusion of mine to the
      children,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;My good friend, Mr. Gallilee, had his own reasons
      for removing his daughters from home for a time&mdash;reasons, I am bound
      to add, in which I concur. The children were to be placed under the care
      of their aunt, Lady Northlake. Unfortunately, her ladyship was away with
      my lord, cruising in their yacht. They were not able to receive Maria and
      Zoe at once. In the interval that elapsed&mdash;excuse my entering into
      particulars&mdash;our excellent friend had his own domestic reasons for
      arranging the&mdash;the sort of clandestine departure which did in fact
      take place. It was perhaps unwise on my part to consent&mdash;in short, I
      permitted some of the necessary clothing to be privately deposited here,
      and called for on the way to the station. Very unprofessional, I am aware.
      I did it for the best; and allowed my friendly feeling to mislead me. Can
      I be of any use? How is poor Miss Carmina? No better? Oh, dear! dear! Mr.
      Ovid will hear dreadful news, when he comes home. Can&rsquo;t we prepare him for
      it, in any way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null announced that a telegram would meet Ovid at Queenstown&mdash;with
      the air of a man who had removed every obstacle that could be suggested to
      him. The kind-hearted lawyer shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no friend who can meet him there?&rdquo; Mr. Mool suggested. &ldquo;I have
      clients depending on me&mdash;cases, in which property is concerned, and
      reputation is at stake&mdash;or I would gladly go myself. You, with your
      patients, are as little at liberty as I am. Can&rsquo;t you think of some other
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null could think of nobody, and had nothing to propose. Of the three
      weak men, now brought into association by the influence of domestic
      calamity, he was the feeblest, beyond all doubt. Mr. Mool had knowledge of
      law, and could on occasion be incited to energy. Mr. Gallilee had warm
      affections, which, being stimulated, could at least assert themselves. Mr.
      Null, professionally and personally, was incapable of stepping beyond his
      own narrow limits, under any provocation whatever. He submitted to the
      force of events as a cabbage-leaf submits to the teeth of a rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving the office, Carmina&rsquo;s medical attendant had his patient to
      see. Since the unfortunate alarm in the house, he had begun to feel
      doubtful and anxious about her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sitting-room, he found Teresa and the landlady in consultation. In
      her own abrupt way, the nurse made him acquainted with the nature of the
      conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have two worries to bother us,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and the music-master is the
      worst of the two. There&rsquo;s a notion at the hospital (set agoing, I don&rsquo;t
      doubt, by the man himself), that I crushed his fingers on purpose. That&rsquo;s
      a lie! With the open cupboard door between us, how could I see him, or he
      see me? When I gave it a push-to, I no more knew where his hand was, than
      you do. If I meant anything, I meant to slap his face for prying about in
      my room. We&rsquo;ve made out a writing between us, to show to the doctors. You
      shall have a copy, in case you&rsquo;re asked about it. Now for the other
      matter. You keep on telling me I shall fall ill myself, if I don&rsquo;t get a
      person to help me with Carmina. Make your mind easy&mdash;the person has
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa pointed to the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recommended by me?&rdquo; Mr. Null inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recommended by herself. And we don&rsquo;t like her. That&rsquo;s the other worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null&rsquo;s dignity declined to attach any importance to the &ldquo;other worry.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;No nurse has any business here, without my sanction! I&rsquo;ll send her away
      directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed open the baize door. A lady was sitting by Carmina&rsquo;s bedside.
      Even in the dim light, there was no mistaking <i>that</i> face. Mr. Null
      recognised&mdash;Miss Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and bowed to him. He returned the bow stiffly. Nature&rsquo;s
      protecting care of fools supplies them with an instinct which distrusts
      ability. Mr. Null never liked Miss Minerva. At the same time, he was a
      little afraid of her. This was not the sort of nurse who could be ordered
      to retire at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting anxiously to see you,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and led the way
      to the farther end of the room. &ldquo;Carmina terrifies me,&rdquo; she added in a
      whisper. &ldquo;I have been here for an hour. When I entered the room her face,
      poor dear, seemed to come to life again; she was able to express her joy
      at seeing me. Even the jealous old nurse noticed the change for the
      better. Why didn&rsquo;t it last? Look at her&mdash;oh, look at her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The melancholy relapse that had followed the short interval of excitement
      was visible to anyone now.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the &ldquo;simulated paralysis,&rdquo; showing itself plainly in every part
      of the face. She lay still as death, looking vacantly at the foot of the
      bed. Mr. Null was inclined to resent the interference of a meddling woman,
      in the discharge of his duty. He felt Carmina&rsquo;s pulse, in sulky silence.
      Her eyes never moved; her hand showed no consciousness of his touch.
      Teresa opened the door, and looked in&mdash;impatiently eager to see the
      intruding nurse sent away. Miss Minerva invited her to return to her place
      at the bedside. &ldquo;I only ask to occupy it,&rdquo; she said considerately, &ldquo;when
      you want rest.&rdquo; Teresa was ready with an ungracious reply, but found no
      opportunity of putting it into words. Miss Minerva turned quickly to Mr.
      Null. &ldquo;I must ask you to let me say a few words more,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;I
      will wait for you in the next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her resolute eyes rested on him with a look which said plainly, &ldquo;I mean to
      be heard.&rdquo; He followed her into the sitting-room, and waited in sullen
      submission to hear what she had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not trouble you by entering into my own affairs,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I
      will only say that I have obtained an engagement much sooner than I had
      anticipated, and that the convenience of my employers made it necessary
      for me to meet them in Paris. I owed Carmina a letter; but I had reasons
      for not writing until I knew whether she had, or had not, left London.
      With that object, I called this morning at her aunt&rsquo;s house. You now see
      me here&mdash;after what I have heard from the servants. I make no
      comment, and I ask for no explanations. One thing only, I must know.
      Teresa refers me to you. Is Carmina attended by any other medical man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null answered stiffly, &ldquo;I am in consultation with Doctor Benjulia; and
      I expect him to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply startled her. &ldquo;Dr. Benjulia?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest man we have!&rdquo; Mr. Null asserted in his most positive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She silently determined to wait until Doctor Benjulia arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the last news of Mr. Ovid?&rdquo; she said to him, after an interval of
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her the news, in the fewest words possible. Even he observed that
      it seemed to excite her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Null! who is to prepare him for what he will see in that room?
      Who is to tell him what he must hear of his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain familiarity in the language of this appeal, which Mr.
      Null felt it necessary to discourage. &ldquo;The matter is left in my hands,&rdquo; he
      announced. &ldquo;I shall telegraph to him at Queenstown. When he comes home, he
      will find my prescriptions on the table. Being a medical man himself, my
      treatment of the case will tell Mr. Ovid Vere everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The obstinate insensibility of his tone stopped her on the point of saying
      what Mr. Mool had said already. She, too, felt for Ovid, when she thought
      of the cruel brevity of a telegram. &ldquo;At what date will the vessel reach
      Queenstown?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By way of making sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Null, &ldquo;I shall telegraph in a week&rsquo;s
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She troubled him with no more inquiries. He had purposely remained
      standing, in the expectation that she would take the hint, and go; and he
      now walked to the window, and looked out. She remained in her chair,
      thinking. In a few minutes more, there was a heavy step on the stairs.
      Benjulia had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked hard at Miss Minerva, in unconcealed surprise at finding her in
      the house. She rose, and made an effort to propitiate him by shaking
      hands. &ldquo;I am very anxious,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;to hear your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hand tells me that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cold hand, on a warm day.
      You&rsquo;re an excitable woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Mr. Null, and led the way into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by herself, Miss Minerva discovered writing materials (placed ready
      for Mr. Null&rsquo;s next prescription) on a side table. She made use of them at
      once to write to her employer. &ldquo;A dear friend of mine is seriously ill,
      and in urgent need of all that my devotion can do for her. If you are
      willing to release me from my duties for a short time, your sympathy and
      indulgence will not be thrown away on an ungrateful woman. If you cannot
      do me this favour, I ask your pardon for putting you to inconvenience, and
      leave some other person, whose mind is at ease, to occupy the place which
      I am for the present unfit to fill.&rdquo; Having completed her letter in those
      terms, she waited Benjulia&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was sadness in her face, but no agitation, as she looked patiently
      towards the bedroom door. At last&mdash;in her inmost heart, she knew it&mdash;the
      victory over herself was a victory won. Carmina could trust her now; and
      Ovid himself should see it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Null returned to the sitting-room alone. Doctor Benjulia had no time
      to spare: he had left the bedroom by the other door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may say (as you seem anxious) that my colleague approves of a proposal,
      on my part, to slightly modify the last prescription. We recognise the new
      symptoms, without feeling alarm.&rdquo; Having issued this bulletin, Mr. Null
      sat down to make his feeble treatment of his patient feebler still.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he looked up again, the room was empty. Had she left the house? No:
      her travelling hat and her gloves were on the other table. Had she boldly
      confronted Teresa on her own ground?
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his modified prescription into the bedroom. There she was, and
      there sat the implacable nurse, already persuaded into listening to her!
      What conceivable subject could there be, which offered two such women
      neutral ground to meet on? Mr. Null left the house without the faintest
      suspicion that Carmina might be the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I try to rouse her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa answered by silently resigning her place at the bedside. Miss
      Minerva touched Carmina&rsquo;s hand, and spoke. &ldquo;Have you heard the good news,
      dear? Ovid is coming back in little more than a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina looked&mdash;reluctantly looked&mdash;at her friend, and said,
      with an effort, &ldquo;I am glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be better,&rdquo; Miss Minerva continued, &ldquo;the moment you see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face became faintly animated. &ldquo;I shall be able to say good-bye,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not good-bye, darling. He is returning to you after a long journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going, Frances, on a longer journey still.&rdquo; She closed her eyes, too
      weary or too indifferent to say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minerva drew back, struggling against the tears that fell fast over
      her face. The jealous old nurse quietly moved nearer to her, and kissed
      her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a brute and a fool,&rdquo; said Teresa; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re almost as
      fond of her as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week later, Miss Minerva left London, to wait for Ovid at Queenstown.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool was in attendance at Fairfield Gardens, when his old friend
      arrived from Scotland, to tell him what the cautiously expressed message
      in the telegram really meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one idea seemed to be impressed on Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s mind&mdash;the idea
      of reconciliation. He insisted on seeing his wife. It was in vain to tell
      him that she was utterly incapable of reciprocating or even of
      understanding his wishes. Absolute resistance was the one alternative left&mdash;and
      it was followed by distressing results. The kind-hearted old man burst
      into a fit of crying, which even shook the resolution of the doctors. One
      of them went upstairs to warn the nurses. The other said, &ldquo;Let him see
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The instant he showed himself in the room, Mrs. Gallilee recognised him
      with a shriek of fury. The nurses held her back&mdash;while Mr. Mool
      dragged him out again, and shut the door. The object of the doctors had
      been gained. His own eyes had convinced him of the terrible necessity of
      placing his wife under restraint. She was removed to a private asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria and Zo had been left in Scotland&mdash;as perfectly happy as girls
      could be, in the society of their cousins, and under the affectionate care
      of their aunt. Mr. Gallilee remained in London; but he was not left alone
      in the deserted house. The good lawyer had a spare room at his disposal;
      and Mrs. Mool and her daughters received him with true sympathy. Coming
      events helped to steady his mind. He was comforted in the anticipation of
      Ovid&rsquo;s return, and interested in hearing of the generous motive which had
      led Miss Minerva to meet his stepson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never agreed with the others when they used to abuse our governess,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;She might have been quick-tempered, and she might have been ugly&mdash;I
      suppose I saw her in some other light myself.&rdquo; He had truly seen her under
      another light. In his simple affectionate nature, there had been
      instinctive recognition of that great heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was allowed to see Carmina, in the hope that pleasant associations
      connected with him might have a favourable influence. She smiled faintly,
      and gave him her hand when she saw him at the bedside&mdash;but that was
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too deeply distressed to ask to see her again, he made his inquiries for
      the future at the door. Day after day, the answer was always the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she left London, Miss Minerva had taken it on herself to engage the
      vacant rooms, on the ground floor of the lodging-house, for Ovid. She knew
      his heart, as she knew her own heart. Once under the same roof with
      Carmina, he would leave it no more&mdash;until life gave her back to him,
      or death took her away. Hearing of what had been done, Mr. Gallilee
      removed to Ovid&rsquo;s rooms the writing-desk and the books, the favourite
      music and the faded flowers, left by Carmina at Fairfield Gardens.
      &ldquo;Anything that belongs to her,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;will surely be welcome to the
      poor fellow when he comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On one afternoon&mdash;never afterwards to be forgotten&mdash;he had only
      begun to make his daily inquiry, when the door on the ground floor was
      opened, and Miss Minerva beckoned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face daunted Mr. Gallilee: he asked in a whisper, if Ovid had
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed upwards, and answered, &ldquo;He is with her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he bear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know; we were afraid to follow him into the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned towards the window as she spoke. Teresa was sitting there&mdash;vacantly
      looking out. Mr. Gallilee spoke to her kindly: she made no answer; she
      never even moved. &ldquo;Worn out!&rdquo; Miss Minerva whispered to him. &ldquo;When she
      thinks of Carmina now, she thinks without hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered. The expression of his own fear was in those words&mdash;and
      he shrank from it. Miss Minerva took his hand, and led him to a chair.
      &ldquo;Ovid will know best,&rdquo; she reminded him; &ldquo;let us wait for what Ovid will
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you meet him on board the vessel?&rdquo; Mr. Gallilee asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So well and so strong that you would hardly have known him again&mdash;till
      he asked about Carmina. Then he turned pale. I knew that I must tell him
      the truth&mdash;but I was afraid to take it entirely on myself. Something
      Mr. Null said to me, before I left London, suggested that I might help
      Ovid to understand me if I took the prescriptions to Queenstown. I had not
      noticed that they were signed by Doctor Benjulia, as well as by Mr. Null.
      Don&rsquo;t ask me what effect the discovery had on him! I bore it at the time&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t speak of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You good creature! you dear good creature! Forgive me if I have
      distressed you; I didn&rsquo;t meant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not distressed me. Is there anything else I can tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee hesitated. &ldquo;There is one thing more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      about Carmina this time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated again. Miss Minerva understood. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I spoke
      to Ovid of his mother. In mercy to himself and to me, he would hear no
      details. &lsquo;I know enough,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if I know that she is the person to
      blame. I was prepared to hear it. My mother&rsquo;s silence could only be
      accounted for in one way, when I had read Zo&rsquo;s letter.&rsquo;&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you
      know, Mr. Gallilee, that the child wrote to Ovid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surprise and delight of Zo&rsquo;s fond old father, when he heard the story
      of the letter, forced a smile from Miss Minerva, even at that time of
      doubt and sorrow. He declared that he would have returned to his daughter
      by the mail train of that night, but for two considerations. He must see
      his stepson before he went back to Scotland; and he must search all the
      toy-shops in London for the most magnificent present that could be offered
      to a young person of ten years old. &ldquo;Tell Ovid, with my love, I&rsquo;ll call
      again to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, looking at his watch. &ldquo;I have just time to
      write to Zo by to-day&rsquo;s post.&rdquo; He went to his club, for the first time
      since he had returned to London. Miss Minerva thought of bygone days, and
      wondered if he would enjoy his champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Mr. Null called&mdash;anxious to know if Ovid had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other women, in the position of Miss Minerva and Teresa, might have
      hesitated to keep the patient&rsquo;s room closed to the doctor. These two were
      resolved. They refused to disturb Ovid, even by sending up a message. Mr.
      Null took offence. &ldquo;Understand, both of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I call
      to-morrow morning, I shall insist on going upstairs&mdash;and if I find
      this incivility repeated, I shall throw up the case.&rdquo; He left the room,
      triumphing in his fool&rsquo;s paradise of aggressive self-conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited for some time longer&mdash;and still no message reached them
      from upstairs. &ldquo;We may be wrong in staying here,&rdquo; Miss Minerva suggested;
      &ldquo;he may want to be alone when he leaves her&mdash;let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to return to the house of her new employers. They respected her,
      and felt for her: while Carmina&rsquo;s illness continued, she had the entire
      disposal of her time. The nurse accompanied her to the door; resigned to
      take refuge in the landlady&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to be by myself,&rdquo; Teresa
      said. &ldquo;Even that woman&rsquo;s chatter is better for me than my own thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before parting for the night they waited in the hall, looking towards the
      stairs, and listening anxiously. Not a sound disturbed the melancholy
      silence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Among many vain hopes, one hope had been realised: they had met again.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the darkened room, her weary eyes could hardly have seen the betrayal
      of what he suffered&mdash;even if she had looked up in his face. She was
      content to rest her head on his breast, and to feel his arm round her. &ldquo;I
      am glad, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to have lived long enough for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those were her first words&mdash;after the first kiss. She had trembled
      and sighed, when he ran to her and bent over her: it was the one
      expression left of all her joy and all her love. But it passed away as
      other lesser agitations had passed away. One last reserve of energy obeyed
      the gentle persuasion of love. Silent towards all other friends, she was
      able to speak to Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used to breathe so lightly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How is it that I hear you
      now. Oh, Ovid, don&rsquo;t cry! I couldn&rsquo;t bear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered her quietly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, darling; I won&rsquo;t distress you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will let me say, what I want to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This satisfied her. &ldquo;I may rest a little now,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He too was silent; held down by the heavy hand of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had been, in the days of his failing health, when the solemn
      shadows of evening falling over the fields&mdash;the soaring song of the
      lark in the bright heights of the midday sky&mdash;the dear lost
      remembrances that the divine touch of music finds again&mdash;brought
      tears into his eyes. They were dry eyes now! Those once tremulous nerves
      had gathered steady strength, on the broad prairies and in the roving
      life. Could trembling sorrow, seeking its way to the sources of tears,
      overbear the robust vitality that rioted in his blood, whether she lived
      or whether she died? In those deep breathings that had alarmed her, she
      had indeed heard the struggle of grief, vainly urging its way to
      expression against the masterful health and strength that set moral
      weakness at defiance. Nature had remade this man&mdash;and Nature never
      pities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an effort to her to collect her thoughts&mdash;but she did collect
      them. She was able to tell him what was in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, Ovid, your mother will care much what becomes of me, when I
      die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started at those dreadful words&mdash;so softly, so patiently spoken.
      &ldquo;You will live,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My Carmina, what am I here for but to bring you
      back to life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no attempt to dispute with him. Quietly, persistently, she
      returned to the thought that was in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that I forgive your mother, Ovid&mdash;and that I only ask one thing
      in return. I ask her to leave me to you, when the end has come. My dear,
      there is a feeling in me that I can&rsquo;t get over. Don&rsquo;t let me be buried in
      a great place all crowded with the dead! I once saw a picture&mdash;it was
      at home in Italy, I think&mdash;an English picture of a quiet little
      churchyard in the country. The shadows of the trees rested on the lonely
      graves. And some great poet had written&mdash;oh, such beautiful words
      about it. <i>The red-breast loves to build and warble there, And little
      footsteps lightly print the ground.</i> Promise, Ovid, you will take me to
      some place, far from crowds and noise&mdash;where children may gather the
      flowers on my grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He promised&mdash;and she thanked him, and rested again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was something else,&rdquo; she said, when the interval had passed. &ldquo;My
      head is so sleepy. I wonder whether I can think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a while, she did think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to make you a little farewell present. Will you undo my gold
      chain? Don&rsquo;t cry, Ovid! oh, don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed her. The gold chain held the two lockets&mdash;the treasured
      portraits of her father and her mother. &ldquo;Wear them for my sake,&rdquo; she
      murmured. &ldquo;Lift me up; I want to put them round your neck myself.&rdquo; She
      tried, vainly tried, to clasp the chain. Her head fell back on his breast.
      &ldquo;Too sleepy,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;always too sleepy now! Say you love me, Ovid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now lay me down on the pillow. I&rsquo;m not eighteen yet&mdash;and I feel as
      old as eighty! Rest; all I want is rest.&rdquo; Looking at him fondly, her eyes
      closed little by little&mdash;then softly opened again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait in
      this dull room, darling; I will send for you, if I wake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the only wish of hers that he disobeyed. From time to time, his
      fingers touched her pulse, and felt its feeble beat. From time to time, he
      stooped and let the faint coming and going of her breath flutter on his
      cheek. The twilight fell, and darkness began to gather over the room.
      Still, he kept his place by her, like a man entranced.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first trivial sound that broke the spell, was the sound of a match
      struck in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and groped his way to the door. Teresa had ventured upstairs, and
      had kindled a light. Some momentary doubt of him kept the nurse silent
      when he looked at her. He stammered, and stared about him confusedly, when
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where&mdash;?&rdquo; He seemed to have lost his hold on his
      thoughts&mdash;he gave it up, and tried again. &ldquo;I want to be alone,&rdquo; he
      said; recovering, for the moment, some power of expressing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa&rsquo;s first fear of him vanished. She took him by the hand like a
      child, and led him downstairs to his rooms. He stood silently watching
      her, while she lit the candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Carmina sleeps now,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;does it last long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often for hours together,&rdquo; the nurse answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more; he seemed to have forgotten that there was another person
      in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found courage in her pity for him. &ldquo;Try to pray,&rdquo; she said, and left
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell on his knees; but still the words failed him. He tried to quiet
      his mind by holy thoughts. No! The dumb agony in him was powerless to find
      relief. Only the shadows of thoughts crossed his mind; his eyes ached with
      a burning heat. He began to be afraid of himself. The active habits of the
      life that he had left, drove him out, with the instincts of an animal,
      into space and air. Neither knowing nor caring in what direction he turned
      his steps, he walked on at the top of his speed. On and on, till the
      crowded houses began to grow more rare&mdash;till there were gaps of open
      ground, on either side of him&mdash;till the moon rose behind a plantation
      of trees, and bathed in its melancholy light a lonely high road. He
      followed the road till he was tired of it, and turned aside into a winding
      lane. The lights and shadows, alternating with each other, soothed and
      pleased him. He had got the relief in exercise that had been denied him
      while he was in repose. He could think again; he could feel the resolution
      stirring in him to save that dear one, or to die with her. Now at last, he
      was man enough to face the terrible necessity that confronted him, and
      fight the battle of Art and Love against Death. He stopped, and looked
      round; eager to return, and be ready for her waking. In that solitary
      place, there was no hope of finding a person to direct him. He turned, to
      go back to the high road.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that same moment, he became conscious of the odour of tobacco wafted
      towards him on the calm night air. Some one was smoking in the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retraced his steps, until he reached a gate&mdash;with a barren field
      behind it. There was the man, whose tobacco smoke he had smelt, leaning on
      the gate, with his pipe in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight fell full on Ovid&rsquo;s face, as he approached to ask his way.
      The man suddenly stood up&mdash;stared at him&mdash;and said, &ldquo;Hullo! is
      it you or your ghost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was in shadow, but his voice answered for him. The man was
      Benjulia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come to see me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you shake hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid waited to answer until he had steadied his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen Carmina,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia went on with his smoking. &ldquo;An interesting case, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were called into consultation by Mr. Null,&rdquo; Ovid continued; &ldquo;and you
      approved of his ignorant treatment&mdash;you, who knew better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think I did!&rdquo; Benjulia rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deliberately encouraged an incompetent man; you let that poor girl go
      on from bad to worse&mdash;for some vile end of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia good-naturedly corrected him. &ldquo;No, no. For an excellent end&mdash;for
      knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I fail to remedy the mischief, which is your doing, and yours alone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia took his pipe out of his mouth. &ldquo;How do you mean to cure her?&rdquo; he
      eagerly interposed. &ldquo;Have you got a new idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I fail,&rdquo; Ovid repeated, &ldquo;her death lies at your door. You merciless
      villain&mdash;as certainly as that moon is now shining over us, your life
      shall answer for hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Astonishment&mdash;immeasurable astonishment&mdash;sealed Benjulia&rsquo;s lips.
      He looked down the lane when Ovid left him, completely stupefied. The one
      imaginable way of accounting for such language as he had heard&mdash;spoken
      by a competent member of his own profession!&mdash;presented the old
      familiar alternative. &ldquo;Drunk or mad?&rdquo; he wondered while he lit his pipe
      again. Walking back to the house, his old distrust of Ovid troubled him
      once more. He decided to call at Teresa&rsquo;s lodgings in a day or two, and
      ascertain from the landlady (and the chemist) how Carmina was being cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the high road, Ovid was passed by a tradesman, driving his
      cart towards London. The man civilly offered to take him as far as the
      nearest outlying cabstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the landlady nor Teresa had gone to their beds when he returned.
      Their account of Carmina, during his absence, contained nothing to alarm
      him. He bade them goodnight&mdash;eager to be left alone in his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house and out of the house, there was now the perfect silence that
      helps a man to think. His mind was clear; his memory answered, when he
      called on it to review that part of his own medical practice which might
      help him, by experience, in his present need. But he shrank&mdash;with
      Carmina&rsquo;s life in his hands&mdash;from trusting wholly to himself. A
      higher authority than his was waiting to be consulted. He took from his
      portmanteau the manuscript presented to him by the poor wretch, whose last
      hours he had soothed in the garret at Montreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work opened with a declaration which gave it a special value, in
      Ovid&rsquo;s estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this imperfect record of experience is ever read by other eyes than
      mine, I wish to make one plain statement at the outset. The information
      which is presented in these pages is wholly derived from the results of
      bedside practice; pursued under miserable obstacles and interruptions, and
      spread over a period of many years. Whatever faults and failings I may
      have been guilty of as a man, I am innocent, in my professional capacity,
      of ever having perpetrated the useless and detestable cruelties which go
      by the name of Vivisection. Without entering into any of the disputes on
      either side, which this practice has provoked, I declare my conviction
      that no asserted usefulness in the end, can justify deliberate cruelty in
      the means. The man who seriously maintains that any pursuit in which he
      can engage is independent of moral restraint, is a man in a state of
      revolt against God. I refuse to hear him in his own defense, on that
      ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid turned next to the section of the work which was entitled &ldquo;Brain
      Disease.&rdquo; The writer introduced his observations in these prefatory words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A celebrated physiologist, plainly avowing the ignorance of doctors in
      the matter of the brain and its diseases, and alluding to appearances
      presented by post-mortem examination, concludes his confession thus: &lsquo;We
      cannot even be sure whether many of the changes discovered are the cause
      or the result of the disease, or whether the two are the conjoint results
      of a common cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this man writes, after experience in Vivisection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let my different experience be heard next. Not knowing into what hands
      this manuscript may fall, or what unexpected opportunities of usefulness
      it may encounter after my death, I purposely abstain from using technical
      language in the statement which I have now to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In medical investigations, as in all other forms of human inquiry, the
      result in view is not infrequently obtained by indirect and unexpected
      means. What I have to say here on the subject of brain disease, was first
      suggested by experience of two cases, which seemed in the last degree
      unlikely to help me. They were both cases of young women; each one having
      been hysterically affected by a serious moral shock; terminating, after a
      longer or shorter interval, in simulated paralysis. One of these cases I
      treated successfully. While I was still in attendance on the other,
      (pursuing the same course of treatment which events had already proved to
      be right), a fatal accident terminated my patient&rsquo;s life, and rendered a
      post-mortem examination necessary. From those starting points, I arrived&mdash;by
      devious ways which I am now to relate&mdash;at deductions and discoveries
      that threw a new light on the nature and treatment of brain disease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hour by hour, Ovid studied the pages that followed, until his mind and the
      mind of the writer were one. He then returned to certain preliminary
      allusions to the medical treatment of the two girls&mdash;inexpressibly
      precious to him, in Carmina&rsquo;s present interests. The dawn of day found him
      prepared at all points, and only waiting until the lapse of the next few
      hours placed the means of action in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one anxiety still to be relieved, before he lay down to
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his shoes, and stole upstairs to Carmina&rsquo;s door. The faithful
      Teresa was astir, earnestly persuading her to take some nourishment. The
      little that he could hear of her voice, as she answered, made his heart
      ache&mdash;it was so faint and so low. Still she could speak; and still
      there was the old saying to remember, which has comforted so many and
      deceived so many: While there&rsquo;s life, there&rsquo;s hope.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After a brief interview with his step-son, Mr. Gallilee returned to his
      daughters in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched by his fatherly interest in Carmina, Ovid engaged to keep him
      informed of her progress towards recovery. If the anticipation of saving
      her proved to be the sad delusion of love and hope, silence would signify
      what no words could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten days&rsquo; time, there was a happy end to suspense. The slow process of
      recovery might extend perhaps to the end of the year. But, if no accident
      happened, Ovid had the best reasons for believing that Carmina&rsquo;s life was
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freed from the terrible anxieties that had oppressed him, he was able to
      write again, a few days later, in a cheerful tone, and to occupy his pen
      at Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s express request, with such an apparently trifling
      subject as the conduct of Mr. Null.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old medical adviser was quite right in informing you that I had
      relieved him from any further attendance on Carmina. But his lively
      imagination (or perhaps I ought to say, his sense of his own consequence)
      has misled you when he also declares that I purposely insulted him. I took
      the greatest pains not to wound his self-esteem. He left me in anger,
      nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day or two afterwards, I received a note from him; addressing me as
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; and asking ironically if I had any objection to his looking at the
      copies of my prescriptions in the chemist&rsquo;s book. Though he was old enough
      to be my father (he remarked) it seemed that experience counted for
      nothing; he had still something to learn from his junior, in the treatment
      of disease&mdash;and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that miserable time of doubt and anxiety, I could only send a verbal
      reply, leaving him to do what he liked. Before I tell you of the use that
      he made of his liberty of action, I must confess something relating to the
      prescriptions themselves. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of long and learned words, and
      don&rsquo;t suppose that I am occupying your attention in this way, without a
      serious reason for it which you will presently understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A note in the manuscript&mdash;to my study of which, I owe, under God,
      the preservation of Carmina&rsquo;s life&mdash;warned me that chemists, in the
      writer&rsquo;s country, had either refused to make up certain prescriptions
      given in the work, or had taken the liberty of altering the new quantities
      and combinations of some of the drugs prescribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely the same thing happened here, in the case of the first chemist
      to whom I sent. He refused to make up the medicine, unless I provided him
      with a signed statement taking the whole responsibility on myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having ascertained the exact nature of his objection, I dismissed him
      without his guarantee, and employed another chemist; taking care (in the
      interests of my time and my temper) to write my more important
      prescriptions under reserve. That is to say, I followed the conventional
      rules, as to quantities and combinations, and made the necessary additions
      or changes from my own private stores when the medicine was sent home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor foolish Mr. Null, finding nothing to astonish him in my course of
      medicine&mdash;as represented by the chemist&mdash;appears by his own
      confession, to have copied the prescriptions with a malicious object in
      view. &lsquo;I have sent them, (he informs me, in a second letter) to Doctor
      Benjulia; in order that he too may learn something in his profession from
      the master who has dispensed with our services.&rsquo; This new effort of irony
      means that I stand self-condemned of vanity, in presuming to rely on my
      own commonplace resources&mdash;represented by the deceitful evidence of
      the chemist&rsquo;s book!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am grateful to Mr. Null, notwithstanding: he has done me a service,
      in meaning to do me an injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My imperfect prescriptions have quieted the mind of the man to whom he
      sent them. This wretch&rsquo;s distrust has long since falsely suspected me of
      some professional rivalry pursued in secret; the feeling showed itself
      again, when I met with him by accident on the night of my return to
      London. Since Mr. Null has communicated with him, the landlady is no
      longer insulted by his visits, and offended by his questions&mdash;all
      relating to the course of treatment which I was pursuing upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You now understand why I have ventured to trouble you on a purely
      professional topic. To turn to matters of more interest&mdash;our dear
      Carmina is well enough to remember you, and to send her love to you and
      the girls. But even this little effort is followed by fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean only fatigue of body: that is now a question of time and
      care. I mean fatigue of mind&mdash;expressing itself by defect of memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the morning when the first positive change for the better appeared, I
      was at her bedside when she woke. She looked at me in amazement. &lsquo;Why
      didn&rsquo;t you warn me of your sudden return?&rsquo; she asked, &lsquo;I have only written
      to you to-day&mdash;to your bankers at Quebec! What does it mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did my best to soothe her, and succeeded. There is a complete lapse in
      her memory&mdash;I am only too sure of it! She has no recollection of
      anything that has happened since she wrote her last letter to me&mdash;a
      letter which must have been lost (perhaps intercepted?), or I should have
      received it before I left Quebec. This forgetfulness of the dreadful
      trials through which my poor darling has passed, is, in itself, a
      circumstance which we must all rejoice over for her sake. But I am
      discouraged by it, at the same time; fearing it may indicate some more
      serious injury than I have yet discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Minerva&mdash;what should I do without the help and sympathy of that
      best of true women?&mdash;Miss Minerva has cautiously tested her memory in
      other directions, with encouraging results, so far. But I shall not feel
      easy until I have tried further experiments, by means of some person who
      does not exercise a powerful influence over her, and whose memory is
      naturally occupied with what we older people call trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you all leave Scotland next month, bring Zo here with you. My dear
      little correspondent is just the sort of quaint child I want for the
      purpose. Kiss her for me till she is out of breath&mdash;and say that is
      what I mean to do when we meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The return to London took place in the last week in October.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord and Lady Northlake went to their town residence, taking Maria and Zo
      with them. There were associations connected with Fairfield Gardens, which
      made the prospect of living there&mdash;without even the society of his
      children&mdash;unendurable to Mr. Gallilee. Ovid&rsquo;s house, still waiting
      the return of its master, was open to his step-father. The poor man was
      only too glad (in his own simple language) &ldquo;to keep the nest warm for his
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latest inquiries made at the asylum were hopefully answered. Thus far,
      the measures taken to restore Mrs. Gallilee to herself had succeeded
      beyond expectation. But one unfavourable symptom remained. She was
      habitually silent. When she did speak, her mind seemed to be occupied with
      scientific subjects: she never mentioned her husband, or any other member
      of the family. Time and attention would remove this drawback. In two or
      three months more perhaps, if all went well, she might return to her
      family and her friends, as sane a woman as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling at Fairfield Gardens for any letters that might be waiting there,
      Mr. Gallilee received a circular in lithographed writing; accompanied by a
      roll of thick white paper. The signature revealed the familiar name of Mr.
      Le Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circular set forth that the writer had won renown and a moderate
      income, as pianist and teacher of music. &ldquo;A terrible accident, ladies and
      gentlemen, has injured my right hand, and has rendered amputation of two
      of my fingers necessary. Deprived for life of my professional resources, I
      have but one means of subsistence left&mdash;<i>viz:</i>&mdash;-collecting
      subscriptions for a song of my own composition. N.B.&mdash;The mutilated
      musician leaves the question of terms in the hands of the art-loving
      public, and will do himself the honour of calling to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good-natured Mr. Gallilee left a sovereign to be given to the victim of
      circumstances&mdash;and then set forth for Lord Northlake&rsquo;s house. He and
      Ovid had arranged that Zo was to be taken to see Carmina that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way through the streets, he was met by Mr. Mool. The lawyer looked
      at the song under his friend&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re taking such care
      of?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It looks like music. A new piece for the young ladies&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee explained. Mr. Mool struck his stick on the pavement, as the
      nearest available means of expressing indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never let another farthing of your money get into that rascal&rsquo;s pocket!
      It&rsquo;s no merit of his that the poor old Italian nurse has not made her
      appearance in the police reports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this preface, Mr. Mool related the circumstances under which Mr. Le
      Frank had met with his accident. &ldquo;His first proceeding when they
      discharged him from the hospital,&rdquo; continued the lawyer, &ldquo;was to summon
      Teresa before a magistrate. Fortunately she showed the summons to me. I
      appeared for her, provided with a plan of the rooms which spoke for
      itself; and I put two questions to the complainant. What business had he
      in another person&rsquo;s room? and why was his hand in that other person&rsquo;s
      cupboard? The reporter kindly left the case unrecorded; and when the
      fellow ended by threatening the poor woman outside the court, we bound him
      over to keep the peace. I have my eye on him&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll catch him yet,
      under the Vagrant Act!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aided by time, care, and skill, Carmina had gained strength enough to pass
      some hours of the day in the sitting-room; reclining in an invalid-chair
      invented for her by Ovid. The welcome sight of Zo&mdash;brightened and
      developed by happy autumn days passed in Scotland&mdash;brought a deep
      flush to her face, and quickened the pulse which Ovid was touching, under
      pretence of holding her hand. These signs of excessive nervous sensibility
      warned him to limit the child&rsquo;s visit to a short space of time. Neither
      Miss Minerva nor Teresa were in the room: Carmina could have Zo all to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear,&rdquo; she said, in a kiss, &ldquo;tell me about Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scotland,&rdquo; Zo answered with dignity, &ldquo;belongs to uncle Northlake. He pays
      for everything; and I&rsquo;m Missus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallilee, bursting with pride. &ldquo;My lord says it&rsquo;s no
      use having a will of your own where Zo is. When he introduces her to
      anybody on the estate, he says, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the Missus.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s youngest daughter listened critically to the parental
      testimony. &ldquo;You see he knows,&rdquo; she said to Ovid. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to laugh
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina tried another question. &ldquo;Did you think of me, dear, when you were
      far away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of you?&rdquo; Zo repeated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to sleep in my bedroom when we go
      back to Scotland&mdash;and I&rsquo;m to be out of bed, and one of &lsquo;em, when you
      eat your first Scotch dinner. Shall I tell you what you&rsquo;ll see on the
      table? You&rsquo;ll see a big brown steaming bag in a dish&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll see
      me slit it with a knife&mdash;and the bag&rsquo;s fat inside will tumble out,
      all smoking hot and stinking. That&rsquo;s a Scotch dinner. Oh!&rdquo; she cried,
      losing her dignity in the sudden interest of a new idea, &ldquo;oh, Carmina, do
      you remember the Italian boy, and his song?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was one of those tests of her memory for trifles, applied with a
      child&rsquo;s happy abruptness, for which Ovid had been waiting. He listened
      eagerly. To his unutterable relief, Carmina laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I remember it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who could forget the boy who sings
      and grins and says <i>Gimmeehaypenny?&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Zo. &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s song was a good one in its way. I&rsquo;ve
      learnt a better in Scotland. You&rsquo;ve heard of Donald, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo turned indignantly to her father. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell her of Donald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee humbly admitted that he was in fault. Carmina asked who
      Donald was, and what he was like. Zo unconsciously tested her memory for
      the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when Joseph had an errand at the grocer&rsquo;s
      and I went along with him, and Miss Minerva said I was a vulgar child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina&rsquo;s memory recalled this new trifle, without an effort. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo;
       she answered; &ldquo;you told me Joseph and the grocer weighed you in the great
      scales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo delighted Ovid by trying her again. &ldquo;When they put me into the scales,
      Carmina, what did I weigh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly four stone, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite four stone. Donald weighs fourteen.&rsquo; What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee once more offered his testimony. &ldquo;The biggest Piper on my
      lord&rsquo;s estate,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;comes of a Highland family, and was removed to
      the Lowlands by my lord&rsquo;s father. A great player&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>my</i> friend,&rdquo; Zo explained, stopping her father in full career.
      &ldquo;He takes snuff out of a cow&rsquo;s horn. He shovels it up his fat nose with a
      spoon, like this. His nose wags. He says, &lsquo;Try my sneeshin.&rsquo; Sneeshin&rsquo;s
      Scotch for snuff. He boos till he&rsquo;s nearly double when uncle Northlake
      speaks to him. Boos is Scotch for bows. He skirls on the pipes&mdash;skirls
      means screeches. When you first hear him, he&rsquo;ll make your stomach ache.
      You&rsquo;ll get used to that&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll find you like him. He wears a
      purse and a petticoat; he never had a pair of trousers on in his life;
      there&rsquo;s no pride about him. Say you&rsquo;re my friend and he&rsquo;ll let you smack
      his legs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, Ovid was obliged to bring the biography of Donald to a close.
      Carmina&rsquo;s enjoyment of Zo was becoming too keen for her strength; her
      bursts of laughter grew louder and louder&mdash;the wholesome limit of
      excitement was being rapidly passed. &ldquo;Tell us about your cousins,&rdquo; he
      said, by way of effecting a diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The big ones?&rdquo; Zo asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the little ones, like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice girls&mdash;they play at everything I tell &lsquo;em. Jolly boys&mdash;when
      they knock a girl down, they pick her up again, and clean her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmina was once more in danger of passing the limit. Ovid made another
      attempt to effect a diversion. Singing would be comparatively harmless in
      its effect&mdash;as he rashly supposed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that song you learnt in
      Scotland?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Donald&rsquo;s song,&rdquo; Zo replied. <i>&ldquo;He</i> taught me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of Donald&rsquo;s dreadful name, Ovid looked at his watch, and said
      there was no time for the song. Mr. Gallilee suddenly and seriously sided
      with his step-son. &ldquo;How she got among the men after dinner,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;nobody knows. Lady Northlake has forbidden Donald to teach her any more
      songs; and I have requested him, as a favour to me, not to let her smack
      his legs. Come, my dear, it&rsquo;s time we were home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well intended by both gentlemen&mdash;but too late. Zo was ready for the
      performance; her hat was cocked on one side; her plump little arms were
      set akimbo; her round eyes opened and closed facetiously in winks worthy
      of a low comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Donald,&rdquo; she announced: and burst out with the
      song: <i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gayly yet, we&rsquo;re gayly yet; We&rsquo;re not very fou, but we&rsquo;re
      gayly yet: Then sit ye awhile, and tipple a bit; For we&rsquo;re not very fou,
      but we&rsquo;re gayly yet.&rdquo;</i> She snatched up Carmina&rsquo;s medicine glass, and
      waved it over her head with a Bacchanalian screech. &ldquo;Fill a brimmer,
      Tammie! Here&rsquo;s to Redshanks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray who is Redshanks?&rdquo; asked a lady, standing in the doorway. Zo
      turned round&mdash;and instantly collapsed. A terrible figure, associated
      with lessons and punishments, stood before her. The convivial friend of
      Donald, the established Missus of Lord Northlake, disappeared&mdash;and a
      polite pupil took their place. &ldquo;If you please, Miss Minerva, Redshanks is
      nickname for a Highlander.&rdquo; Who would have recognised the singer of &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      gayly yet,&rdquo; in the subdued young person who made that reply?
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened again. Another disastrous intrusion? Yes, another! Teresa
      appeared this time&mdash;caught Zo up in her arms&mdash;and gave the child
      a kiss that was heard all over the room. &ldquo;Ah, mia Giocosa!&rdquo; cried the old
      nurse&mdash;too happy to speak in any language but her own. &ldquo;What does
      that mean?&rdquo; Zo asked, settling her ruffled petticoats. &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said
      Teresa, who prided herself on her English, &ldquo;Ah, my Jolly.&rdquo; This to a young
      lady who could slit a haggis! This to the only person in Scotland,
      privileged to smack Donald&rsquo;s legs! Zo turned to her father, and recovered
      her dignity. Maria herself could hardly have spoken with more severe
      propriety. &ldquo;I wish to go home,&rdquo; said Zo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid had only to look at Carmina, and to see the necessity of immediate
      compliance with his little sister&rsquo;s wishes. No more laughing, no more
      excitement, for that day. He led Zo out himself, and resigned her to her
      father at the door of his rooms on the ground floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheered already by having got away from Miss Minerva and the nurse, Zo
      desired to know who lived downstairs; and, hearing that these were Ovid&rsquo;s
      rooms, insisted on seeing them. The three went in together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ovid drew Mr. Gallilee into a corner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m easier about Carmina now,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;The failure of her memory doesn&rsquo;t extend backwards. It begins with
      the shock to her brain, on the day when Teresa removed her to this house&mdash;and
      it will end, I feel confident, with the end of her illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s attention suddenly wandered. &ldquo;Zo!&rdquo; he called out, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      touch your brother&rsquo;s papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The one object that had excited the child&rsquo;s curiosity was the
      writing-table. Dozens of sheets of paper were scattered over it, covered
      with writing, blotted and interlined. Some of these leaves had overflowed
      the table, and found a resting-place on the floor. Zo was amusing herself
      by picking them up. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said, handing them obediently to Ovid,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had many a rap on the knuckles for writing not half as bad as
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing his daughter&rsquo;s remark, Mr. Gallilee became interested in looking
      at the fragments of manuscript. &ldquo;What an awful mess!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;May I
      try if I can read a bit?&rdquo; Ovid smiled. &ldquo;Try by all means; you will make
      one useful discovery at least&mdash;you will see that the most patient men
      on the face of the civilised earth are Printers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee tried a page&mdash;and gave it up before he turned giddy. &ldquo;Is
      it fair to ask what this is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something easy to feel, and hard to express,&rdquo; Ovid answered. &ldquo;These
      ill-written lines are my offering of gratitude to the memory of an unknown
      and unhappy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man you told me of, who died at Montreal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never mentioned his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His last wishes forbade me to mention it to any living creature. God
      knows there were pitiable, most pitiable, reasons for his dying unknown!
      The stone over his grave only bears his initials, and the date of his
      death. But,&rdquo; said Ovid, kindling with enthusiasm, as he laid his hand on
      his manuscript, &ldquo;the discoveries of this great physician shall benefit
      humanity! And my debt to him shall be acknowledged, with the admiration
      and the devotion that I truly feel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a book?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gallilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a book that is now being printed. You will see it before the New
      Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding nothing to amuse her in the sitting-room, Zo had tried the bedroom
      next. She now returned to Ovid, dragging after her a long white staff that
      looked like an Alpen-stock. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;A broomstick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A specimen of rare Canadian wood, my dear. Would you like to have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zo took the offer quite seriously. She looked with longing eyes at the
      specimen, three times as tall as herself&mdash;and shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not big enough for it, yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look at it, papa! Benjulia&rsquo;s stick
      is nothing to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That name&mdash;on the child&rsquo;s lips&mdash;had a sound revolting to Ovid.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of him!&rdquo; he said irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t I speak of him,&rdquo; Zo asked, &ldquo;when I want him to tickle me?&rdquo; Ovid
      beckoned to her father. &ldquo;Take her away now,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;and never
      let her see that man again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warning was needless. The man&rsquo;s destiny had decreed that he and Zo
      were never more to meet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Benjulia&rsquo;s servants had but a dull time of it, poor souls, in the lonely
      house. Towards the end of December, they subscribed among themselves to
      buy one of those wonderful Christmas Numbers&mdash;presenting year after
      year the same large-eyed ladies, long-legged lovers, corpulent children,
      snow landscapes, and gluttonous merry-makings&mdash;which have become a
      national institution: say, the pictorial plum puddings of the English
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants had plenty of time to enjoy their genial newspaper, before
      the dining-room bell disturbed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some weeks past, the master had again begun to spend the whole of his
      time in the mysterious laboratory. On the rare occasions when he returned
      to the house, he was always out of temper. If the servants knew nothing
      else, they knew what these signs meant&mdash;the great man was harder at
      work than ever; and in spite of his industry, he was not getting on so
      well as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular evening, the bell rang at the customary time&mdash;and
      the cook (successor to the unfortunate creature with pretensions to beauty
      and sentiment) hastened to get the dinner ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman turned to the dresser, and took from it a little heap of
      newspapers; carefully counting them before he ventured to carry them
      upstairs. This was Doctor Benjulia&rsquo;s regular weekly supply of medical
      literature; and here, again, the mysterious man presented an
      incomprehensible problem to his fellow-creatures. He subscribed to every
      medical publication in England&mdash;and he never read one of them! The
      footman cut the leaves; and the master, with his forefinger to help him,
      ran his eye up and down the pages; apparently in search of some
      announcement that he never found&mdash;and, still more extraordinary,
      without showing the faintest sign of disappointment when he had done.
      Every week, he briskly shoved his unread periodicals into a huge basket,
      and sent them downstairs as waste paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman took up the newspapers and the dinner together&mdash;and was
      received with frowns and curses. He was abused for everything that he did
      in his own department, and for everything that the cook had done besides.
      &ldquo;Whatever the master&rsquo;s working at,&rdquo; he announced, on returning to the
      kitchen, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s farther away from hitting the right nail on the head than
      ever. Upon my soul, I think I shall have to give warning! Let&rsquo;s relieve
      our minds. Where&rsquo;s the Christmas Number?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, the servants were startled by a tremendous bang of the
      house-door which shook the whole building. The footman ran upstairs: the
      dining-room was empty; the master&rsquo;s hat was not on its peg in the hall;
      and the medical newspapers were scattered about in the wildest confusion.
      Close to the fender lay a crumpled leaf, torn out. Its position suggested
      that it had narrowly missed being thrown into the fire. The footman
      smoothed it out, and looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One side of the leaf contained a report of a lecture. This was dry
      reading. The footman tried the other side, and found a review of a new
      medical work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would have been dull reading too, but for an extract from a Preface,
      stating how the book came to be published, and what wonderful discoveries,
      relating to peoples&rsquo; brains, it contained. There were some curious things
      said here&mdash;especially about a melancholy deathbed at a place called
      Montreal&mdash;which made the Preface almost as interesting as a story.
      But what was there in this to hurry the master out of the house, as if the
      devil had been at his heels?
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Benjulia&rsquo;s nearest neighbour was a small farmer named Gregg. He was
      taking a nap that evening, when his wife bounced into the room, and said,
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the big doctor gone mad!&rdquo; And there he was truly, at Mrs. Gregg&rsquo;s
      heels, clamouring to have the horse put to in the gig, and to be driven to
      London instantly. He said, &ldquo;Pay yourself what you please&rdquo;&mdash;and opened
      his pocket-book, full of bank-notes. Mr. Gregg said, &ldquo;It seems, sir, this
      is a matter of life or death.&rdquo; Whereupon he looked at Mr. Gregg&mdash;and
      considered a little&mdash;and, becoming quiet on a sudden, answered, &ldquo;Yes,
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the road to London, he never once spoke&mdash;except to himself&mdash;and
      then only from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, judging by what fell from him now and then, that he was
      troubled about a man and a letter. He had suspected the man all along; but
      he had nevertheless given him the letter&mdash;and now it had ended in the
      letter turning out badly for Doctor Benjulia himself. Where he went to in
      London, it was not possible to say. Mr. Gregg&rsquo;s horse was not fast enough
      for him. As soon as he could find one, he took a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shopman of Mr. Barrable, the famous publisher of medical works, had
      just put up the shutters, and was going downstairs to his tea, when he
      heard a knocking at the shop door. The person proved to be a very tall
      man, in a violent hurry to buy Mr. Ovid Vere&rsquo;s new book. He said, by way
      of apology, that he was in that line himself, and that his name was
      Benjulia. The shopman knew him by reputation, and sold him the book. He
      was in such a hurry to read it, that he actually began in the shop. It was
      necessary to tell him that business hours were over. Hearing this, he ran
      out, and told the cabman to drive as fast as possible to Pall Mall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library waiter at Doctor Benjulia&rsquo;s Club found him in the library,
      busy with a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite alone; the members, at that hour of the evening, being
      generally at dinner, or in the smoking-room. The man whose business it was
      to attend to the fires, went in during the night, from time to time, and
      always found him in the same corner. It began to get late. He finished his
      reading; but it seemed to make no difference. There he sat&mdash;wide
      awake&mdash;holding his closed book on his knee, seemingly lost in his own
      thoughts. This went on till it was time to close the Club. They were
      obliged to disturb him. He said nothing; and went slowly down into the
      hall, leaving his book behind him. It was an awful night, raining and
      sleeting&mdash;but he took no notice of the weather. When they fetched a
      cab, the driver refused to take him to where he lived, on such a night as
      that. He only said, &ldquo;Very well; go to the nearest hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night porter at the hotel let in a tall gentleman, and showed him into
      one of the bedrooms kept ready for persons arriving late. Having no
      luggage, he paid the charges beforehand. About eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, he rang for the waiter&mdash;who observed that his bed had not
      been slept in. All he wanted for breakfast was the strongest coffee that
      could be made. It was not strong enough to please him when he tasted it;
      and he had some brandy put in. He paid, and was liberal to the waiter, and
      went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman on duty, that day, whose beat included the streets at the
      back of Fairfield Gardens, noticed in one of them, a tall gentleman
      walking backwards and forwards, and looking from time to time at one
      particular house. When he passed that way again, there was the gentleman
      still patrolling the street, and still looking towards the same house. The
      policeman waited a little, and watched. The place was a respectable
      lodging house, and the stranger was certainly a gentleman, though a queer
      one to look at. It was not the policeman&rsquo;s business to interfere on
      suspicion, except in the case of notoriously bad characters. So, though he
      did think it odd, he went on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Ovid left his Lodgings,
      to go to the neighbouring livery stables, and choose an open carriage. The
      sun was shining, and the air was brisk and dry, after the stormy night. It
      was just the day when he might venture to take Carmina out for a drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way down the street, he heard footsteps behind him, and felt
      himself touched on the shoulder. He turned&mdash;and discovered Benjulia.
      On the point of speaking resentfully, he restrained himself. There was
      something in the wretch&rsquo;s face that struck him with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you long; I want to know one thing. Will she
      live or die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her life is safe&mdash;I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through your new mode of treatment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes and his voice said more than his words. Ovid instantly knew that
      he had seen the book; and that the book had forestalled him in the
      discovery to which he had devoted his life. Was it possible to pity a man
      whose hardened nature never pitied others? All things are possible to a
      large heart. Ovid shrank from answering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we met that night at my garden gate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you told me my life
      should answer for her life, if she died. My neglect has not killed her&mdash;and
      you have no need to keep your word. But I don&rsquo;t get off, Mr. Ovid Vere,
      without paying the penalty. You have taken something from me, which was
      dearer than life, I wished to tell you that&mdash;I have no more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ovid silently offered his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjulia&rsquo;s head drooped in thought. The generous protest of the man whom
      he had injured, spoke in that outstretched hand. He looked at Ovid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said&mdash;and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the street, he went round to Fairfield Gardens, and rang the bell
      at Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s door. The bell was answered by a polite old woman&mdash;a
      stranger to him among the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Zo in the house?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s in the house, sir. It&rsquo;s to be let, if you please, as soon as the
      furniture can be moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where Zo is? I mean, Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s youngest child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say, sir, I&rsquo;m not acquainted with the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited at the door, apparently hesitating what to do next. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
      upstairs,&rdquo; he said suddenly; &ldquo;I want to look at the house. You needn&rsquo;t go
      with me; I know my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you kindly, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went straight to the schoolroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repellent melancholy of an uninhabited place had fallen on it already.
      The plain furniture was not worth taking care of: it was battered and old,
      and left to dust and neglect. There were two common deal writing desks,
      formerly used by the two girls. One of them was covered with splashes of
      ink: varied here and there by barbarous caricatures of faces, in which
      dots and strokes represented eyes, noses, and mouths. He knew whose desk
      this was, and opened the cover of it. In the recess beneath were soiled
      tables of figures, torn maps, and dogs-eared writing books. The ragged
      paper cover of one of these last, bore on its inner side a grotesquely
      imperfect inscription:&mdash;<i>my cop book zo.</i> He tore off the cover,
      and put it in the breast pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have liked to tickle her once more,&rdquo; he thought, as he went down
      stairs again. The polite old woman opened the door, curtsying
      deferentially. He gave her half a crown. &ldquo;God bless you, sir!&rdquo; she burst
      out, in a gush of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked himself, on the point of stepping into the street, and looked
      at her with some curiosity. &ldquo;Do you believe in God?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was even capable of making a confession of faith politely.
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you have no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the street. &ldquo;I wonder whether she is right?&rdquo; he thought.
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter; I shall soon know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servants were honestly glad to see him, when he got home. They had
      taken it in turn to sit up through the night; knowing his regular habits,
      and feeling the dread that some accident had happened. Never before had
      they seen him so fatigued. He dropped helplessly into his chair; his
      gigantic body shook with shivering fits. The footman begged him to take
      some refreshment. &ldquo;Brandy, and raw eggs,&rdquo; he said. These being brought to
      him, he told them to wait until he rang&mdash;and locked the door when
      they went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      After waiting until the short winter daylight was at an end, the footman
      ventured to knock, and ask if the master wanted lights. He replied that he
      had lit the candles for himself. No smell of tobacco smoke came from the
      room; and he had let the day pass without going to the laboratory. These
      were portentous signs. The footman said to his fellow servants, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      something wrong.&rdquo; The women looked at each other in vague terror. One of
      them said, &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better give notice to leave?&rdquo; And the other
      whispered a question: &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s committed a crime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Towards ten o&rsquo;clock, the bell rang at last. Immediately afterwards they
      heard him calling to them from the hall. &ldquo;I want you, all three, up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went up together&mdash;the two women anticipating a sight of horror,
      and keeping close to the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master was walking quietly backwards and forwards in the room: the
      table had pen and ink on it, and was covered with writings. He spoke to
      them in his customary tones; there was not the slightest appearance of
      agitation in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to leave this house, and go away,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You are dismissed
      from my service, for that reason only. Take your written characters from
      the table; read them, and say if there is anything to complain of.&rdquo; There
      was nothing to complain of. On another part of the table there were three
      little heaps of money. &ldquo;A month&rsquo;s wages for each of you,&rdquo; he explained,
      &ldquo;in place of a month&rsquo;s warning. I wish you good luck.&rdquo; One of the women
      (the one who had suggested giving notice to leave) began to cry. He took
      no notice of this demonstration, and went on. &ldquo;I want two of you to do me
      a favour before we part. You will please witness the signature of my
      Will.&rdquo; The sensitive servant drew back directly. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t do it. I never heard the Death-Watch before in winter time&mdash;I
      heard it all last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other two witnessed the signature. They observed that the Will was a
      very short one. It was impossible not to notice the only legacy left; the
      words crossed the paper, just above the signatures, and only occupied two
      lines: &ldquo;I leave to Zoe, youngest daughter of Mr. John Gallilee, of
      Fairfield Gardens, London, everything absolutely of which I die
      possessed.&rdquo; Excepting the formal introductory phrases, and the statement
      relating to the witnesses&mdash;both copied from a handy book of law,
      lying open on the table&mdash;this was the Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The female servants were allowed to go downstairs; after having been
      informed that they were to leave the next morning. The footman was
      detained in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to the laboratory,&rdquo; the master said; &ldquo;and I want a few things
      carried to the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big basket for waste paper, three times filled with letters and
      manuscripts; the books; the medicine chest; and the stone jar of oil from
      the kitchen&mdash;these, the master and the man removed together; setting
      them down at the laboratory door. It was a still cold starlight winter&rsquo;s
      night. The intermittent shriek of a railway whistle in the distance, was
      the only sound that disturbed the quiet of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; said the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man returned the salute, and walked back to the house, closing the
      front door. He was now more firmly persuaded than ever that something was
      wrong. In the hall, the women were waiting for him. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;
       they asked. &ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute he was posted at the back of the house, behind the edge
      of the wall. Looking out from this place, he could see the light of the
      lamps in the laboratory streaming through the open door, and the dark
      figure of the master coming and going, as he removed the objects left
      outside into the building. Then the door was shut, and nothing was visible
      but the dim glow that found its way to the skylight, through the white
      blind inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He boldly crossed the open space of ground, resolved to try what his ears
      might discover, now that his eyes were useless. He posted himself at the
      back of the laboratory, close to one of the side walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then, he heard&mdash;what had reached his ears when he had been
      listening on former occasions&mdash;the faint whining cries of animals.
      These were followed by new sounds. Three smothered shrieks, succeeding
      each other at irregular intervals, made his blood run cold. Had three
      death-strokes been dealt on some suffering creatures, with the same sudden
      and terrible certainty? Silence, horrible silence, was all that answered.
      In the distant railway there was an interval of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened again; the flood of light streamed out on the
      darkness. Suddenly the yellow glow was spotted by the black figures of
      small swiftly-running creatures&mdash;perhaps cats, perhaps rabbits&mdash;escaping
      from the laboratory. The tall form of the master followed slowly, and
      stood revealed watching the flight of the animals. In a moment more, the
      last of the liberated creatures came out&mdash;a large dog, limping as if
      one of its legs was injured. It stopped as it passed the master, and tried
      to fawn on him. He threatened it with his hand. &ldquo;Be off with you, like the
      rest!&rdquo; he said. The dog slowly crossed the flow of light, and was
      swallowed up in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of them that could move was gone. The death shrieks of the others
      had told their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, there stood the master alone&mdash;a grand black figure, with
      its head turned up to the stars. The minutes followed one another: the
      servant waited, and watched him. The solitary man had a habit, well known
      to those about him, of speaking to himself; not a word escaped him now;
      his upturned head never moved; the bright wintry heaven held him
      spellbound.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, the change came. Once more the silence was broken by the scream
      of the railway whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started like a person suddenly roused from deep sleep, and went back
      into the laboratory. The last sound then followed&mdash;the locking and
      bolting of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant left his hiding-place: his master&rsquo;s secret, was no secret now.
      He hated himself for eating that master&rsquo;s bread, and earning that master&rsquo;s
      money. One of the ignorant masses, this man! Mere sentiment had a strange
      hold on his stupid mind; the remembrance of the poor wounded dog,
      companionable and forgiving under cruel injuries, cut into his heart like
      a knife. His thought at that moment, was an act of treason to the royalty
      of Knowledge,&mdash;&ldquo;I wish to God I could lame <i>him,</i> as he has
      lamed the dog!&rdquo; Another fanatic! another fool! Oh, Science, be merciful to
      the fanatics, and the fools!
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got back to the house, the women were still on the look-out for
      him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get to your beds. And, mind this&mdash;let&rsquo;s
      be off to-morrow morning before <i>he</i> can see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no sleep for him when he went to his own bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of the dog tormented him. The other lesser animals were
      active; capable of enjoying their liberty and finding shelter for
      themselves. Where had the maimed creature found a refuge, on that bitter
      night? Again, and again, and again, the question forced its way into his
      mind. He could endure it no longer. Cautiously and quickly&mdash;in dread
      of his extraordinary conduct being perhaps discovered by the women&mdash;he
      dressed himself, and opened the house door to look for the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the darkness on the step, there rose something dark. He put out his
      hand. A persuasive tongue, gently licking it, pleaded for a word of
      welcome. The crippled animal could only have got to the door in one way;
      the gate which protected the house-enclosure must have been left open.
      First giving the dog a refuge in the kitchen, the footman&mdash;rigidly
      performing his last duties&mdash;went to close the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his first step into the enclosure he stopped panic-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The starlit sky over the laboratory was veiled in murky red. Roaring
      flame, and spouting showers of sparks, poured through the broken skylight.
      Voices from the farm raised the first cry&mdash;&ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the inquest, the evidence suggested suspicion of incendiarism and
      suicide. The papers, the books, the oil betrayed themselves as combustible
      materials, carried into the place for a purpose. The medicine chest was
      known (by its use in cases of illness among the servants) to contain
      opium. Adjourned inquiry elicited that the laboratory was not insured, and
      that the deceased was in comfortable circumstances. Where were the
      motives? One intelligent man, who had drifted into the jury, was satisfied
      with the evidence. He held that the desperate wretch had some reason of
      his own for first poisoning himself, and then setting fire to the scene of
      his labours. Having a majority of eleven against him, the wise juryman
      consented to a merciful verdict of death by misadventure. The hideous
      remains of what had once been Benjulia, found Christian burial. His
      brethren of the torture-table, attended the funeral in large numbers.
      Vivisection had been beaten on its own field of discovery. They honoured
      the martyr who had fallen in their cause.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The life of the New Year was still only numbered by weeks, when a modest
      little marriage was celebrated&mdash;without the knowledge of the
      neighbours, without a crowd in the church, and even without a
      wedding-breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee (honoured with the office of giving away the bride) drew Ovid
      into a corner before they left the house. &ldquo;She still looks delicate, poor
      dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you really consider her to be well again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as she will ever be,&rdquo; Ovid answered. &ldquo;Before I returned to her,
      time had been lost which no skill and no devotion can regain. But the
      prospect has its bright side. Past events which might have cast their
      shadow over all her life to come, have left no trace in her memory. I will
      make her a happy woman. Leave the rest to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa and Mr. Mool were the witnesses; Maria and Zo were the bridesmaids:
      they had only waited to go to church, until one other eagerly expected
      person joined them. There was a general inquiry for Miss Minerva. Carmina
      astonished everybody, from the bride-groom downwards, by announcing that
      circumstances prevented her best and dearest friend from being present.
      She smiled and blushed as she took Ovid&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;When we are man and wife,
      and I am quite sure of you,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I will tell <i>you,</i> what
      nobody else must know. In the meantime, darling, if you can give Frances
      the highest place in your estimation&mdash;next to me&mdash;you will only
      do justice to the noblest woman that ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a little note hidden in her bosom, while she said those words. It
      was dated on the morning of her marriage: &ldquo;When you return from the
      honeymoon, Carmina, I shall be the first friend who opens her arms and her
      heart to you. Forgive me if I am not with you to-day. We are all human, my
      dear&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was her last weakness. Carmina had no excuses to make for an absent
      guest, when the first christening was celebrated. On that occasion the
      happy young mother betrayed a conjugal secret to her dearest friend. It
      was at Ovid&rsquo;s suggestion that the infant daughter was called by Miss
      Minerva&rsquo;s christian name.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the married pair went away to their happy new life, there was a
      little cloud of sadness, which vanished in sunshine&mdash;thanks to Zo.
      Polite Mr. Mool, bent on making himself agreeable to everybody, paid his
      court to Mr. Gallilee&rsquo;s youngest daughter. &ldquo;And who do you mean to marry,
      my little Miss, when you grow up?&rdquo; the lawyer asked with feeble drollery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zo looked at him in grave surprise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all settled,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      got a man waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! And who may he be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Donald!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very extraordinary child of yours,&rdquo; Mr. Mool said to his friend,
      as they walked away together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallilee absently agreed. &ldquo;Has my message been given to my wife?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mool sighed and shook his head. &ldquo;Messages from her husband are as
      completely thrown away on her,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;as if she was still in the
      asylum. In justice to yourself, consent to an amicable separation, and I
      will arrange it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insisted on it, before I met her lawyers. She declares herself to be an
      infamously injured woman&mdash;and, upon my honour, she proves it, from
      her own point of view. &lsquo;My husband never came near me in my illness, and
      took my children away by stealth. My children were so perfectly ready to
      be removed from their mother, that neither of them had the decency to
      write me a letter. My niece contemplated shamelessly escaping to my son,
      and wrote him a letter vilifying his mother in the most abominable terms.
      And Ovid completes the round of ingratitude by marrying the girl who has
      behaved in this way.&rsquo; I declare to you, Gallilee, that was how she put it!
      &lsquo;Am I to blame,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for believing that story about my brother&rsquo;s
      wife? It&rsquo;s acknowledged that she gave the man money&mdash;the rest is a
      matter of opinion. Was I wrong to lose my temper, and say what I did say
      to this so-called niece of mine? Yes, I was wrong, there: it&rsquo;s the only
      case in which there is a fault to find with me. But had I no provocation?
      Have I not suffered? Don&rsquo;t try to look as if you pitied me. I stand in no
      need of pity. But I owe a duty to my own self-respect; and that duty
      compels me to speak plainly. I will have nothing more to do with the
      members of my heartless family. The rest of my life is devoted to
      intellectual society, and the ennobling pursuits of science. Let me hear
      no more, sir, of you or your employers.&rsquo; She rose like a queen, and bowed
      me out of the room. I declare to you, my flesh creeps when I think of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I leave her now,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallilee, &ldquo;I leave her in debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your word of honour not to mention what I am going to tell you,&rdquo;
       Mr. Mool rejoined. &ldquo;If she needs money, the kindest man in the world has
      offered me a blank cheque to fill in for her&mdash;and his name is Ovid
      Vere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As the season advanced, two social entertainments which offered the most
      complete contrast to each other, were given in London on the same evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Ovid Vere had a little dinner party to celebrate their
      return. Teresa (advanced to the dignity of housekeeper) insisted on
      stuffing the tomatoes and cooking the macaroni with her own hand. The
      guests were Lord and Lady Northlake; Maria and Zo; Miss Minerva and Mr.
      Mool. Mr. Gallilee was present as one of the household. While he was in
      London, he and his children lived under Ovid&rsquo;s roof. When they went to
      Scotland, Mr. Gallilee had a cottage of his own (which he insisted on
      buying) in Lord Northlake&rsquo;s park. He and Zo drank too much champagne at
      dinner. The father made a speech; and the daughter sang, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gayly
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another quarter of London, there was a party which filled the street
      with carriages, and which was reported in the newspapers the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gallilee was At Home to Science. The Professors of the civilised
      universe rallied round their fair friend. France, Italy, and Germany
      bewildered the announcing servants with a perfect Babel of names&mdash;and
      Great Britain was grandly represented. Those three superhuman men, who had
      each had a peep behind the veil of creation, and discovered the mystery of
      life, attended the party and became centres of three circles&mdash;the
      circle that believed in &ldquo;protoplasm,&rdquo; the circle that believed in
      &ldquo;bioplasm,&rdquo; and the circle that believed in &ldquo;atomized charges of
      electricity, conducted into the system by the oxygen of respiration.&rdquo;
       Lectures and demonstrations went on all through the evening, all over the
      magnificent room engaged for the occasion. In one corner, a fair
      philosopher in blue velvet and point lace, took the Sun in hand
      facetiously. &ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s life, my friends, begins with a nebulous infancy
      and a gaseous childhood.&rdquo; In another corner, a gentleman of shy and
      retiring manners converted &ldquo;radiant energy into sonorous vibrations&rdquo;&mdash;themselves
      converted into sonorous poppings by waiters and champagne bottles at the
      supper table. In the centre of the room, the hostess solved the serious
      problem of diet; viewed as a method of assisting tadpoles to develop
      themselves into frogs&mdash;with such cheering results that these last
      lively beings joined the guests on the carpet, and gratified intelligent
      curiosity by explorations on the stairs. Within the space of one
      remarkable evening, three hundred illustrious people were charmed,
      surprised, instructed, and amused; and when Science went home, it left a
      conversazione (for once) with its stomach well filled. At two in the
      morning, Mrs. Gallilee sat down in the empty room, and said to the learned
      friend who lived with her,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, I&rsquo;m a happy woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      THE END. <br /> <br />

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
